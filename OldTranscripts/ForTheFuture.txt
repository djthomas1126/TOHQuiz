Luz: We gotta stick together!

[The ground starts shaking and the Titan's skull starts to crack. Cut to the moment during the Day of Unity when Luz tries to grab on to King, not letting him go.]

King: [sadly] I'm sorry. Not this time.

Luz: [tears rolling] No...!

King: Luz, I'm so happy I had you as a big sister.

[King inhales, then lets out a sonic scream, pushing Luz, Amity, Willow, Gus, and Hunter through the portal and into the Human Realm. Scene then cuts back to show a view of the portal from the Demon Realm.]

Luz: King!!!

[The portal door closes, then explodes into pieces. Cut to King looking at camera tearfully.]

King: [sorrowfully] Goodbye.

[King is suddenly pulled upwards to The Collector, causing him to yell out in fright. Up above, The Collector does a backflip while he is surrounded by stones and colourful ribbon like light trails.]

The Collector: I'M FREE!!! I'm free! Oh this is the goodest I've felt in forever and ever, it's like the whole world is singing!

[As The Collector speaks, meteors appear behind him and drops to the ground. He then grabs King and spins around, then waves his hand, producing multiple stars. Cut to a POV from somewhere above the location of the Draining Spell. Multiple meteors shoot towards the ground and produces smoke and sparkles when it lands. Cut to a chaotic scene of people running around and screaming in terror.]

King: Yeah, I wouldn't call that singingâ€¦

The Collector: So, tell me about your game "The Owl House". You promised you'll teach me if I stopped the Draining Spell!

King: Well, it's uh... like playing pretend. We get roles and go on adventures. But this is too crazy! [gestures towards below] We can't play if you are freaking everyone out!

Lilith: King!

[The Collector and King looks towards the source of sound. Cut to Lilith coming up carrying Hooty in his backpack, with Hooty acting as the Hootycopter. They then land somewhere below, with meteors landing all around them.]

Lilith: What are you doing up there?

Hooty: WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

Lilith: [sternly] I don't know what you are, but STAY AWAY FROM MY NEPHEW!

[As Lilith almost finishes her sentence, she flies upwards with Hooty towards King and the Collector.]

The Collector: That's my best friend you're talking to. Hands OFF!

[As The Collector speaks, he takes out a crescent moon from his sleeve and flings it towards Lilith. Lilith gasps.]

Hooty: LULU!!!

[Hooty immediately stops spinning and wraps around Lilith to protect her, so the crescent moon hits him instead. Consequently, Hooty got turned into a Jack-in-the-box like puppet. Lilith sees this and gasps.]

Lilith: Hootsifer!

[Lilith starts falling, but another crescent moon immediately hits her in the forehead, turning her into a puppet. The Collector then lifts up their hand, and both puppet Hooty and Lilith disappear in a puff of smoke.]

King: [angrily] You can't hurt people either!

The Collector: But they're not hurt! They are safe and sound in our new house.

[As The Collector speaks, they point upwards towards a U-shaped castle building floating above, which is surrounded by rocks and ribbon-like light trails. King looks up at the building with a worried look on his face.]

The Collector: Now, what part do I get to play?

[As he speaks, The Collector wraps their arms around King and pulls him closer. They then grin at King, while King looks at them with a terrified expression.]

[A meteor shoots towards the ground. Cut to Eda kneeling, wrapping her only arm left around Raine, with their head resting on Eda's knees. Osran, Eberwolf, and Adrian can be seen lying nearby, still unconscious. The meteor lands in front of Eda, producing a large puff of smoke, stars, and sparkles. Soon, Raine wakes up, and both Eda and Raine stare at each other lovingly. Raine notices Eda's missing right arm and becomes sad, reaching out their hand to touch it. Both of them then turn their heads and look up, noticing The Collector grabbing onto King's arm as he does a backflip happily, producing more light trails and stars as he does so. Eda and Raine then look at each other. Raine gives Eda an approving nod, and Eda smiles. Immediately, she activates her harpy mode and turns into harpy Eda in front of Raine, causing them to stare in admiration. Eda then takes off, leaving Raine behind. Cut to the Collector looking all around him in amazement as he surrounds himself with meteors.]

[Somewhere below, Kikimora climbs out of a hole in her Abomatron. A flash catches her attention. She looks up, and immediately becomes shocked. Cut to a large star exploding in a bright flash, disappears, then explodes again, sending a large wave filled with sparkles across the entire Boiling Isles.]

[A scroll then appears, telling the viewer what has happened from citizens' POV, using multiple Penstagram accounts.]

[This picture from the account "Horns_Not_Thorns" shows people trying to run away from the DOU location, with meteors about to land near them.]

HORNS_NOT_THORNS:

[This picture from the spike-headed student's account "friendly_neighborhood_pointyhead" is taken from behind Boscha and the Construction coven teacher. It shows Principal Bump and teachers from Hexside trying to fight off the star-shaped robotic creatures, with the Oracle teacher turning into a puppet after being hit in the forehead by a crescent moon from the star robot.]

FRIENDLY_NEIGHBORHOOD_POINTYHEAD:

OHMYTITAN OH NO NO NONOONO

#HEXSIDE #DAYOFUNITY #HELP

[This picture from the account "Daily_Knee_Views" is taken from somewhere at the Knee. It shows The Collector's castle floating in the distance, the entire Boiling Isles being shrouded in The Collector's waves, and meteors shooting towards the ground. No description is available.]

[Cut to Harpy Eda flying upwards towards King and The Collector, dodging meteors and rocks along the way. As she gets nearer to them, her beast form suddenly starts to take over, forcing her to land on a piece of rock nearby. She takes out a bottle of elixir, only to find it empty. The Collector then comes over and presses his hand on Eda's bottle.]

The Collector: You look fun! Wanna play?

[The Collector grins at Eda. Upon seeing him up close, Eda's inner Owl Beast immediately takes over her. It screeches and pounces towards The Collector.]

[OPENING THEME, BUT IT ONLY SHOWS THE SHOW'S TITLE.]

[Scene cuts to Luz floating in a pool of dark-coloured water.]

Luz: Huh?

[Luz opens her eyes, and notices that she is in the In Between Realm. She stands up and looks around, then looks up, noticing a figure walking far above her. The figure pants, then stops to catch their breath. The figure then continues walking, notices Luz, and waves at her. Luz waves back, with a puzzled look on her face. She is then suddenly pulled downwards into the water. Over at the Demon Realm, Amity successfully pulls Luz out from the portal, causing them both to fall backwards. Cut to Willow, Amity, Camila, and Gus looking at camera with a worried expression on their faces.]

Amity: Luz!

[Cut to the quartet and Hunter looking down at Luz, with Amity helping Luz to sit up. The portal disappears behind them.]

Amity: You were in there for so long, we- we thought you got stuck behind! Are you... hurt anywhere?

[Amity places her hand below Luz's chin.]

Luz: I'm... I- I'm fine.

[Luz gently grabs Amity's hand and puts it down.]

Luz: I... saw something or... someone. But it was probably just in my head. [starts to stand up] Any sign of... him?

Hunter: Oh come on! It's not like a swarm of ghosts will inexplicably appear if you say his name! ...I think. Anyway, if Belos WAS here, he's long gone now.

[As Hunter almost finishes his sentence, the scene zooms out, showing the sextet standing in front of a gate, and the location appears to be where Eda found her portal in the first place.]

Camila: Well, he better stay out of our way. This mama's HUNGRY FOR VENGANCE! [squints angrily]

Gus: [smiles] Now THAT is a fight I'd watch!

[Cut to the sextet walking down a path through the forest. They look around in bewilderment.]

[Willow pokes out from behind a tree.]

Willow: Okay, everyone. Coast is clear. Hmm?

[Willow notices some red grass nearby.]

Willow: Oh, hello, red grass! I've missed you! [whispers] I can't talk for long, we're on a mission to save the Boiling Isles.

[Behind Willow, Gus uses his illusion tricks to make two red grass fairies appear beside her.]

Red grass fairies: Willow's back, hooray!

[The fairies hug Willow, causing her to laugh in excitement. Hunter sees this and smiles, but a chirping sound grabs his attention which reminds him of Flapjack, and he immediately looks above. On a tree branch nearby, a red bird can be seen cleaning its feathers. It then takes out its head and flies away. Cut to Gus looking at Willow playing with the fairies happily, with Amity, Camila, and Luz walking towards them. Hunter becomes irritated and groans.]

Hunter: Well we don't have time for "red grass" or... i- illusions! [starts striding] Belos had a head start, so we should keep moving until we find him!

[Gus and Willow watch as Hunter walks away with a dejected look on their faces. Gus uses a spell circle to make his illusions disappear. Willow notices Gus becoming gloomy and tries to cheer him up.]

Willow: Don't worry! I bet we'll all feel better when we punch Belos RIGHT through the face. And yes, I mean THROUGH the face.

Gus: [laughs] Thanks, Willow. You're always looking out for us, aren't ya?

Willow: [smiles] Well someone has to! And it looks like my job here is done.

[As Willow speaks, she draws a spell circle and summons some vines from the ground, then rides away while standing on top of the vines.]

Camila: [amazed] Oh-ho-ho-ho, wow! You kids were really holding back in the Human Realm, huh?

Amity: Maybe a little.

[Amity notices some Abomination goo on the ground and summons them towards her.]

Amity: Ah! Hello, you gorgeous slime!

[As she speaks, she wraps the Abomination goo around her hands to form a pair of Abomination gloves, then unwraps it and plays with the goo, laughing happily in the process. Luz sees this and blushes, with a smile on her face. But soon, she becomes gloomy again, and Camila notices this.]

Camila: Mija, you never told me how pretty this place was! [gestures around her] The trees, the sky, quÃ© belleza...AHHHHH!!!

[Camila screams before she can finish her sentence. In front of the sextet, the entire Boiling Isles has turned into a fantasy like world, with oddly shaped trees, stars, sparkles, bright colors, and The Collector's castle floating in the distance. Part of the Titan's skull is also missing. Camila rushes forwards and shields the kids behind her.]

Camila: Kids, stand back! [squints] Who knows if that monster is alive or not?

Amity: Actually, the... Titan skull is normal. Everything else is... wrong.

[As Amity speaks, scene cuts to the view of the new Boiling Isles again. Cut to a waterfall with sparkles. Cut to a view of a forest, with 2 shooting stars jumping from the ground, giggling like children, then falls back down.]

Willow: Guys? What's on top of the skull?

[Scene shows the Collector's castle.]

Luz: I don't know, but... maybe we can get some answers in Bonesborough.

[Hunter, Willow, Gus, and Amity start walking down the slope.]

Camila: Wow! Skulls, bones... I can really see this place helping you with your taxidermy hobby.

[Luz walks towards Camila and places her hand on Camila's arm.]

Luz: Mama, you're pretending to like this place, aren't you? [smiles weakly]

Camila: Nooooo! I love the fact that you've been living on a giant... carcass. [smiles awkwardly]

Luz: It's sweet of you, really. But I haven't changed my mind.

[Camila turns and looks at Luz with a worried expression.]

Luz: After we rescue Eda and King, I'm staying in the Human Realm. Permanently. [walks away] It's for the best.

Camila: Wait, let's talk first!

[Camila sighs, then follows Luz down the slope.]

[Somewhere deep in the forest, a butterfly lands on a rock, but Belos slams his hand on the creature, as he slowly crawls forward. The goo he left behind produces some toxic black smoke. Belos screeches, and he suddenly sees the apparition of Caleb in front of him. A bloodstained dagger is hovering above Caleb's head.]

Belos: Don't... mock me! I tried to save your soul. It's your fault this all happened!

[Belos screeches, and uses his arms to take a swipe at Caleb, trying to slice him apart. However, the blades go through the apparition, without harming Caleb at all. Belos pants heavily, with goo dripping down all over his body. His left arm suddenly breaks apart, revealing the bone underneath it. Belos groans and drops to the ground, while Caleb just stares at him judgingly.]

Belos: I need... a new body.

[Belos climbs past Caleb and deeper into the forest. Camera pans up to show The Collector's castle.]

[Scene cuts to POV from behind a tree. Luz walks forward, sees something, and gasps, She immediately rushes forward, with Amity and Gus following her from behind. Cut to Luz coming to a stop in front of the Owl House and looks up. The house appears abandoned, with graffitis all over it. Camila and the kids come up from behind.]

Camila: What is this place?

[Luz walks forward, grabs on the front door's handle, and leans on it, with a pained look on her face. She then turns around.]

Luz: Welcome...

[Cut to POV from inside the Owl House as Luz opens the front door.]

Luz: ... to the Owl House.

[Luz looks at the interior with a melancholic look on her face.]

[Camila opens a cupboard and finds a partially eaten apple and a dead rat inside. She's grossed out by the dead rat and makes a face. Cut to Hunter pacing back and forth outside, with Clover and Emmeline following him from behind. Willow and Gus look at this from the kitchen window inside as they sit on the ledge.]

Camila: So... this is the... Owl House I heard so much about?

Willow: Yeah... but don't worry, the food's usually not THAT spoiled. [gestures at the dead rat Camila is holding]

Camila: Food?? [chuckles nervously and puts down the dead rat] I need some advice.

Gus: Well first you have to pluck out all the dire rat's extra heads. The tiny ones that line the digestive tract might still be bitey, so-

Camila: I- [exasperated sigh] No, I need advice about Luz.

[Camila picks up a chair and sits down.]

Camila: See, she's planning to... make a very bad decision for herself. She's so determined to make herself sad, and... [sigh] I don't know what to do.

[Willow and Gus look at Camila with a concerned look on their faces.]

Gus: That... reminds me of when I failed my first school project. I thought I deserved to be grounded so... I ran off to live in a cave in the most DRAMATIC way possible! Of course, reliable ol' Willow finds me and says...

Willow: [clears throat] "Augustus, it's okay to fail. Look at me! I fail all the time!"

Gus: "Oh yeah?" I said, "Like when?" Suddenly, there's this BIG slimy explosion in the distance!

[Willow giggles as Gus speaks.]

Willow: "Like tonight! I forgot to chain up my Abomination homework."

[Gus and Willow laughs while reminiscing about this past incident. Camila smiles nervously.]

Camila: [to herself] They have to chain up their homework...?

Gus: Maybe Luz is going through something like that. My dad didn't care if I failed that project, but... [tears up] I didn't want to fail him. And... [sniffles] Oh man, I- I hope he's okay.

[Willow moves forward and hugs Gus to console him.]

Willow: Don't worry, we'll get him back. I'll make sure of it.

[Camila is about to console the kids when she is suddenly interrupted by Hunter yelling outside.]

Hunter: STOP!

[The trio looks outside. Cut to Hunter yelling at Clover and Emmeline.]

Hunter: Stop following me! Belos could be anywhere by now, and we're just- SITTING HERE!

[A twig snaps in the distance. Hunter gasps and looks towards the source of the sound, putting his hand in a gripping position to summon his staff out of habit. He then realizes that he can no longer do that, and groans in frustration. Then, he starts pacing again. Cut back to Gus, Wilow, and Camila.]

Willow: ...we should make sure he doesn't pace himself into the boiling sea.

[Gus wipes off his tear.]

Gus: Good call. Besides, you're probably the only one strong enough to drag him back up.

[Gus walks away, and Willow follows him from behind. Camila calls out to her and stops her.]

Camila: Willow? Hold on. How are you feeling?

Willow: Don't worry about me! You heard what Gus said, I- I'm the reliable one!

Camila: It's okay to be scared too. It's not good if you try to hold it all in.

[Willow stares at Camila, then puts on a cheery attitude.]

Willow: I'm fine, really! And I think you'll be fine too. You and Luz are a lot alike.

[Willow turns around and walks away. Her expression changes once she's facing away from Camila. Camila then notices a trail of plants emerging from the ground behind Willow as she walks away, and looks up with a concerned look on her face.]

[Cut to the corridor outside Eda's room. Amity and Ghost emerge from around the corner and walks down the corridor. She looks around melancholically, then suddenly, she steps onto something. She looks down and notices that it's a picture frame. She picks it up, smiles at the photo, then walks into Eda's room. The room is filled with balls of Light glyphs floating in the air. Amity and Ghost walk towards Eda's bed/nest. Amity then looks down at it.]

Amity: Hey.

[Luz is lying in the nest holding her Palisman egg. She glances back at Amity.]

Luz: Hey.

Amity: Did... you think sitting in a nest was... gonna help your palisman hatch?

Luz: Maybe. [dejectedly] But nothing's happening.

Amity: Remember what the Bat Queen said. To connect with the palisman, you need to express your deepest wish.

[Luz sits up.]

Luz: I never asked. How did you connect with your palisman?

Amity: Well, after being handled the staff, I said "I wanna be a great witch! Or... uh, I don't know, I... wanna be an author like Mildred Featherwhyle!" But... she wouldn't move, until I admitted that... I don't know what I'm gonna be when I grow up, but... I wanna choose the path myself. And that was enough.

[As Amity speaks, she scratches Ghost's head, much to her delight. Ghost then rubs her head against Amity's face.]

[Luz looks back at her egg and slides down, looking bummed out.]

Luz: I wanna be a witch, and help my friends. But doing one always seem to mess up the other. Why did this get so complicated?

[Amity rubs her hand on Luz's head, causing Luz to look up at her.]

Amity: You just gotta be patient.

[Amity gives Luz's head a kiss, but Luz looks away from her and stares down gloomily. Amity notices this.]

Amity: And this isn't the... only reason you're in here. Is it?

[Amity shows Luz the photo frame she just found. Inside the frame is a family picture consisting of Eda, Luz, King, and Hooty. Eda, Luz, and King have the same matching sweaters, while Hooty wears glasses and has a bowtie with the same colour palette. The photo is of a vintage style, with Hooty appearing in the background looking semi-transparent.]

[Luz sits up and looks up at the ceiling.]

Luz: [determined] I'll find Eda and King. No matter how long it takes.

Hunter: IT'S EDA AND KING!

[From outside, Hunter suddenly yells. Luz and Amity look towards the source of sound looking surprised, then stare back at each other.]

[Cut to Hunter, Willow, and Gus looking up at the sky. Amity, Luz, and Camila run up to them from behind. A meteor shoots past above their heads.]

Hunter: [points towards the meteor] They were on that shooting star!

Camila: How are we supposed to follow them?

Amity: Don't worry.

[Camila turns to look at Amity, who has Ghost on her shoulder. Amity boops Ghost's nose, turning her into her staff. Beside her, Willow and Gus turn their Palismen into staffs too.]

Amity: I'm a safe flier.

[Both Hunter and Luz approach the trio. All five of them ready to take off on staffs.]

Camila: [shocked] Flier??

[Cut to the sextet flying across Bonesborough. Hunter rides on Willow's staff, Luz rides on Gus' staff, and Camila rides on Amity's staff. Camila is terrified and keeps her eyes shut, tears flying. The sextet then lands at somewhere in Bonesborough. They get off their staffs and look around.]

Camila: Whoo, those things need seatbelts.

[Camila gets off Amity's staff.]

Camila: [sighs in relief] Hello, sweet earth.

[Camila leans on a lamp post and slides down. She suddenly hears growling and looks down, realizing that she's sitting atop some creature. One of the creature's eyes opens, stares at her and blinks. Camila screams in terror and jumps up, ready to fight the creature, but she notices everyone staring at her and immediately hides the bat behind her.]

Camila: I- I mean, [bows] hello, good sir...?

[The creature becomes happy at Camila's politeness.]

[Scene then cuts to a broken swing in the Slayground. Scene changes to show the six walking around Bonesborough, but find it completely deserted and abandoned. The buildings are filled with graffiti and the windows boarded up.]

Willow: Where are Eda and King?

Gus: Where is... anyone?

[The group then arrives at downtown Bonesborough. Hunter peeks behind an abandoned stall.]

Hunter: [turns around] Something's coming.

Gus: Witches?

Willow: Demons?

Hunter: No, it- it's... [squints and turns around] sparkles??

[Hunter looks back and hears a sound with a bright, sparkling wave coming towards him. He immediately turns around and runs away. Noticing the wave, the rest of the group gasps, turns around and runs away too. All of them hide in an alley with the waves passing right beside them.]

[Once the wave passes, Luz and Amity peek out, and sees that the town square has now been completely overhauled: Skies with colourful rainbows, new stalls, new statue, and chalk drawings on the floor. Multiple puppets who used to be Bonesborough citizens are also now standing there. Amity notices two puppets who used to be Cat and Amelia standing nearby, and becomes creeped out.]

Willow: Dad?!

[Willow notices a puppet who used to be Gilbert standing among the crowd. Puppet Gilbert's eyes flashes yellow, then starts hopping along with the other puppets, whose eyes are also flashing yellow. A jingle plays in the background. Suddenly, the puppets start screaming and running around. Willow runs out and chases after Gilbert.]

Willow: Stop, it's- it's me! Have you seen papa? Wait!

[Hunter rushes outside and holds Willow back. Suddenly, something crashes through the wall of a building beside them, and Hunter immediately drags Willow away. Once the smoke disperses, Owl Beast Eda can be seen standing there.]

Luz: Eda...?

[Owl Beast Eda starts chasing the puppets, causing them to run around and scream. Gilbert is forced into a corner as Owl Beast Eda approaches him. Upon seeing this, Willow gasps, summons her staff and prepares to rescue her dad. Right as Owl Beast Eda is about to attack Gilbert, a bright beam shoots from the sky into the ground behind her.]

The Collector: Stop right there, beast!

[Owl Beast Eda turns around and looks up. Willow's expression changes from being determined to surprised. Cut to Collector and King riding on a star platform from the sky and to the ground. They stare at Owl Beast Eda judgingly.]

The Collector: Fear not, citizens of Bonesborough! [jumps down from the platform] I'm here to stop this beast's mad rampage!

King: [thumbs up] I believe in you, Collector!

The Collector: Thanks, best friend!

[The Collector gives two thumbs up and winks at King. Luz is shocked at the sight of this.]

The Collector: Light glyph, GO!!!

[The Collector waves his right arm and opens up his palm. A bright flash emerges from the palm, blinding Owl Beast Eda as she screeches and drops to the ground. The puppets around start cheering and clapping. Suddenly, Terra emerges from beneath the costume dressed as Eda.]

Terra: [unenthusiastically] Oh, hooray. I'm back to normal.

Luz: [incredulously] What??

[Both Luz and Amity look at this unbelievably. Terra stands up, straightens her back, and groans.]

Terra: Who's got a pint of Apple Blood? Hoot hoot.

The Collector: [groans] Time out, everyone! Time out!

[The puppets stop moving and become limp. The Collector approaches Terra frustratedly.]

The Collector: Terra, for the last time, Eda doesn't sound like that! She's got more of a- like a- a cool aunt vibe who pretends to be all cold-hearted but actually cares a lot!

Terra: Ugh, you're a real thorn in my side, you know that? [points at The Collector] I've had it with YOU and your STUPID LITTLE DOG!

[The Collector becomes shocked at how Terra calls King and glances back at him. They then become angry.]

Terra: Ugh, whatever. All I have to do is play Eda the Owl Lady and I don't get turned into one of those things, right? Then, let's just continue. "Oooh, I LIKE MUSICIANS!" [pretends to be cute]

[The Collector becomes furious.]

The Collector: You're not being very nice right now!

[As he speaks, The Collector holds up a crescent moon on their right palm.]

Terra: Wait!

[Terra becomes terrified. The Collector flings the moon towards Terra, which hits her in the forehead and turns her into a puppet. The Collector then turns around and walks away. Luz, Amity, Gus, Camila, Willow, and Hunter look at what just unfolded in front of them with a shocked expression on their faces. Cut to The Collector sitting on the star platform gloomily as he spins around. King approaches them.]

King: Collector, buddy, you gotta stop doing that. [stops the platform] Think about what you're doing to these people!

The Collector: You are so BO-RING! [looks back at King] I'm just playing pretend!

King: Even playing pretend has consequences. [sadly] A cranky old witch taught me that.

The Collector: [excitedly] You mean Eda, right? That's what we need! The real thing! A cranky, know-it-all, mentor figure. No substitutes allowed! Maybe if I ask real nice, I wouldn't have to turn her into a puppet!

King: [climbs up the platform] N- No! Her curse is still... um... in effect.

[The Collector becomes sad and turns away, hugging their knees. King puts his hand on their shoulder.]

King: But I can check if she's feeling better.

[The Collector is cheered up.]

The Collector: You promise?

King: You can trust me, Collector.

[King offers his pinky finger, and The Collector shakes it back with their pinky finger, making a pinky promise. Cut to Camila approaching Luz from behind.]

Camila: Is that the little King guy you were telling me about?

Luz: [nods and smiles] Mm-hmm.

Camila: Â¡Ay, quÃ© lindo! (Translation: Oh, how cute!)

[Camila blushes. Cut back to King and The Collector on the star platform.]

The Collector: Come on, King! Let's go back to the Archive House.

[As he speaks, the Collector slams his hands on the platform, activating it.]

Luz: Wait, no! Not yet!

[Luz runs out and tries to chase after King and The Collector, but they have already took off on the platform. The puppets start disappearing in puff of smokes around Luz and the entire illusion covering the area also fades away.]

Luz: King...

[Camila, Amity, and Gus come out from the alley and stand behind Luz.]

Camila: [to Amity] O- Okay, okay. The eyeballs in the ground are normal, but the little space cherub is the danger??

[Hunter and Willow run up from behind and approach the quartet.]

Hunter: We should follow them. Belos is probably trying to get back to The Collector!

Gus: I- It looked like they were... playing a game.

Luz: [turns around] Yeah, with some kind of... messed up version of my life! King must have told them about our adventures.

Gus: Do you think everyone who was turned into a puppet gets locked in the Archives?

[Luz climbs up the platform where Belos' statue used to be at and looks up. She sees the star platform carrying King and Collector going back to The Collector's castle floating in the sky.]

Luz: If they do, then that's where we have to go.

Mattholomule: You'll never make it.

[Everyone is surprised at the sudden appearance of Mattholomule's voice.]

Luz: Hmm?

[Everyone turns to look at the source of sound. Cut to the six looking up at a building as Mattholomule puts his foot down on the ledge. Cut to Skara, Mattholumule, and Barcus staring down from top of the building.]

Mattholumule: â€˜cause you guys are LO-SERS! [smirks]

[Scene changes back to show the situation at Hexside during the Day of Unity. In the gym, Principal Bump unrolls some mattresses on the floor. 2 children laugh, run towards the mattresses, and one of them throw themselves onto a mattress. The spider teacher kneels down beside them. Principal Bump smiles as he looks at the children, then turns around. Behind him, the teachers stand nearby and have a worried expression on their faces. Some students are resting on the mattresses, while some are sitting on the seats inside the gym. The photo class teacher approaches Bo and offers her a tray filled with hot drinks, and she takes one cup. Cut to Amelia, Boscha, and Cat putting on their grudgby gear. As the scene plays, Skara can be heard narrating, explaining what happened.]

Skara: [narrating] Since the Golden Guard... I- I mean Hunter, told us about the Emperor's plan for the Day of Unity, Principal Bump allowed students and teachers to camp out at Hexside.

[Scene shows Mattholomule holding up a makeshift mace.]

Mattholomule: [narrating] We thought we could handle whatever the Emperor threw at us.

[Cut to Jerbo pouring some food into Barcus' bowl.]

Mattholomule: [narrating] But when the Draining Spell hit...

[Scene shows the gym being covered in red glow as Jerbo and Barcus turn their heads to look outside. Cut to them looking outside the window, as the yellow beam, which are magical powers being drained from the people at the Draining Spell center, shoots up from the location and onto the moon. The entire sky is now blood red. Cut to Skara and some other students looking at the scene outside completely shocked. They then look to their left, and see Principal Bump and the teachers fall to the ground as their magical powers are being drained. Cut to Bo and Viney rushing over to help Bump up. Bump rolls up his sleeve, and shows lines forming on his arm, coming right from the Abomination sigil on his wrist. Bo covers her mouth in shock.]

Mattholomule: [narrating] ...we realized things wouldn't be so simple.

[Cut to Skara looking shocked. Behind her, outside, the spell is still being draining everyone's powers, and the sky remains red. Cut to the moon being suddenly shifted aside, stopping the Draining Spell.]

Mattholumule: [narrating] After the adults recovered...

[Scene shows teachers and Bump being helped up by students.]

Skara: [narrating] That's when The Collector's Spies showed up.

[The one-eyed goat student and an Illusion track student look out the window, as one of the star-shaped robotic creatures fly past them, causing them to gasp in shock. Scene changes to show The Collector's spies surrounding Hexside. Boscha, Cat, and Amelia kick open the front door, ready to fight off the spies as they hold fiery grudgby balls in their hands.]

Skara: [narrating] The grudgby team snuck out, and tried to hold them back, but...

[Cat, Amelia, and Boscha launch their grudgy balls at one of the spies, but it manages to dodge all of them. It then teleports behind Boscha, and prepares to launch a crescent moon at her. Amelia immediately rushes over and pushes Boscha aside, both falling to the ground. Cat protects the duo by running over and standing in between them and the spy. Consequently, the crescent moon hits her instead. Amelia stands up, and before she can react, another crescent moon hits her in the forehead, causing her to gasp. Both Amelia and Cat turn into puppets and fall to the ground in front of Boscha.]

Boscha: Huh?

[Puppet Amelia and Cat disappears in a puff of smoke. Boscha looks up and gasps, as the spy approaches her above and prepares to launch another crescent moon. Before it can do so, some Abomination goo hits it from behind. Cut to Bump with active spell circles drawn with his hands, and behind him, the school teachers prepare to fight the spies. Cut to Bump and the teachers rushing forward, as Boscha is being helped up and taken away by the spike-headed student and the Construction teacher.]

Mattholomule: [narrating] It didn't work.

[A crescent moon hits the Oracle teacher on the forehead. Another crescent moon hits the Detention teacher in the face. A spy then launches another crescent moon at Bump, which hits him in the forehead before he can finish drawing a spell circle, turning him into a puppet. Around Bump, all the other teachers have also been turned into puppets.]

Mattholomule: [narrating] Bump and the adults were turned into toys and taken away!

[The teacher puppets disappear in puffs of smokes. The spies then fly up and away from Hexside.]

Mattholumule: [narrating] We've been hiding here ever since.

[Back in present day, Mattholumule and Skara lead the way with the sextet following them from behind.]

Mattholomule: And somewhere along the way, I went from being Mattholomule...

[Scene changes around Mattholomule to become more sparklier, creating a dramatic effect.]

Mattholomule: ... to "Man"tholomule.

[Mattholomule makes a duck face and scratches his chin, forming a dark line on it. Cut to Willow, Hunter, Gus, Luz, and Amity with a repulsed look on their faces. Camila snickers.]

Skara: Shhh!

[Skara stops everyone dead in their tracks as she looks above, causing everyone to look up as well. Above them, another one of the Collector's spies fly past them without noticing their existence. Mattholomule then instructs everyone to keep moving forward after he is sure that the coast is clear. Soon, everyone approaches the school building. Cut to Skara and Mattholomule approaching the front door. Skara drags a crate aside while Mattholomule removes a piece of board blocking the door. Barcus and the sextet walk up and stairs and approach the door.]

Skara: We did a little redecorating these past few months. So let me welcome you to...

[Skara and Mattholomule push the doors open.]

Skara: ...new Hexside!

[The sextet gasps. Cut to a POV from further inside the building. The interior is now rather messy, and the situation is chaotic. A student swings past on a rope and knocks 2 people to the ground. Mary uses an Abomination hand to reach somewhere higher, but a kindergartener hisses at her and shoos her away. 2 students in casts walk past.]

[Skara, Mattholomule, and Barcus lead the sextet into the building.]

Gus: This does not smell great.

[The sextet looks around. A glass breaks. Camila notices something and gasps.]

Mary: Heads up!

[A fireball flies past Luz and barely misses her as she quickly dodges. The fireball lands somewhere behind and explodes. Luz looks back with a nervous expression.]

[The sextet is then led into the school cafeteria, which has now been turned into a market. Students can be seen selling food and weapons. A student stoles food from another student and runs away, forcing the student to chase after him. On a table, a student can be seen eating something which does not appear to taste great.]

[Cut to a student selling T-shirts at a stall.]

Beast-keeping student: T-shirts! Get your T-shirts!

[Cut to another student selling candies at a stall.]

Oracle student: Bootleg candy! Now that your mama's a puppet, it's time to eat that candy!

[Camila and Luz pass by the stall. A small Bard student jumps up and bites on the Oracle student's hand, causing them to yell in fright as they try to shake off the Bard student.]

[Cut to POV from inside a classroom. Braxas and a few other kindergarteners have formed a circle, with Barcus standing and the rest sitting. To Braxas' right, a plushie with star-shaped cutout over its face can be seen. Amity, Gus, and Camila pass by the classroom outside, but Camila stops and looks when she hears Braxas speaking.]

Braxas: I'll save you, father!

[Braxas takes out a paper-made shuriken, kisses it with his tongue, and flings it towards the plushie. It slices right through the head and lodges itself on the wall behind. The other kindergarteners pounces towards the plushie and starts destroying it.]

Braxas: Let the blood of your enemies give you strength!

[Upon seeing this, Camila makes a face and walks away. Cut to Mattholomule, Skara, and Barcus standing in front of a statue. Luz and the rest approach them from behind. Mattholomule places his right hand on his chest.]

Mattholomule: This, is a statue of Principal Bump, who risked his life for ours.

[Mattholomule, Barcus, and Skara salutes the statue with a sad expression on their faces. Barcus barks.]

Camila: It's so nice to see teachers getting the respect they deserve.

[Camera zooms out to show the statue, which shows Bump all swagged out skateboarding. The words engraved on the pillar says "IN MEMORY OF THE COOLEST PRINCIPAL EVER" "PRINCIPAL BUMP AKA "PRINCY B""]

Camila: ...I think.

[The students notice Luz and the gang and start gathering over, whispering among themselves. Luz, Amity, and Camila look up at the students.]

Student 1: Do you see who's back?

Student 2: Look who it is.

Student 3: Oh my gosh, it's Amity.

[Gus and Willow look up happily too, with Willow waving at the students.]

Student 4: Hey, where've you guys been? Who's tall Luz?

Viney: Willow!

[Viney runs up to Willow from behind and grabs her hands.]

Viney: I'm so glad you're back! Your orchids have become sentient and have started a war with a roving gang of kindergarteners. Please help!

[Eileen approaches Gus with a paper clip in her hand and mumbles something at Gus, asking him something.]

Gus: No! Human paper clips are NOT a good meat substitute! Have people been eating those??

[Eileen glances backwards with a nervous expression, then immediately runs off.]

Emira: Mittens?!

Amity: Em!

[Amity hears Emira's sound behind her and immediately turns around, as Emira pulls her into a hug and spins her around, both smiling happily.]

Edric: Heya, sis!

[Emira and Amity's eyes shoot open and look towards Edric, who is in a full body cast, approaching them.]

Edric: Amity!!!

[Bo tries to hold Edric back but is dragged behind instead, and the bandage soon tears off.]

Amity: Oh. My. Titan!

[Edric tries to hug Amity, but falls forward instead, and is stopped by Amity.]

Emira: Ed, you're gonna hurt yourself!

Edric: I don't care, I wanna hug my sister!

[Edric screams as he eventually manages to break the cast surrounding his arms apart, and pulls Amity into a hug.]

Edric: Siblings!

Amity: What happened??

Edric: After you and dad left the factory, I BRAVELY set off to find you. Then I was tragically cornered by one of the Collector's spies.

Emira: When he was running away, he fell into an empty well.

Edric: Not empty! There were rocks at the bottom.

[Amity tears up and smiles.]

Amity: Come here you weirdos!

[Amity, Edric, and Emira hug each other together, smiling.]

[Cut to a student riding on an Abomination passing through a corridor. The Abomination steps onto the people sleeping in the corridor, but they keep on sleeping.]

Willow: No offense, but this seems a bit...

Camila: Disgusting.

Viney: Yeah, but... we're just... following orders.

Luz: From who?

[The PA system of the school starts up as Boscha speaks through it.]

Boscha: [clears throat] Attention! Would Captain Tholomule escort his guests to the Council Chamber? And DO IT NOW!

Willow: [puzzled] Captain WHO?

Gus: Wait, has Tholomule been your last name this whole time?!

[As Gus speaks, he slowly turns around to look at Matt. Matt only shrugs.]

[Scene changes to show The Collector's castle. Camera then tilts down, showing the forest underneath it. Belos struggles to climb forward, finally stopping in front of a stone wall and draws a glyph combination on it. He then slams on the glyph combo, activating it and unlocks the door. Cut to the interior, which shows piles of skulls, skeletons, and broken Golden Guard masks. Belos keeps on crawling forward, getting increasingly tired and out of breath. Suddenly, he notices the apparitions of Caleb and the past Golden Guards next to him.]

Belos: Oh, shut up.

[Belos keeps on crawling forward, finally arriving at the room where he used to make Grimwalkers.]

Belos: There has to be one left...

[Cut to a hand sticking out from dirt next to Belos. He notices this, immediately screeches, and pounces towards the hand. He swallows up the hand and disappears into the pile of dirt underneath it. A while later, the hand starts twitching.]

[Somewhere above the sky, The Collector and King flies through the clouds on the star shaped platform. The Collector laughs in excitement as he flips the platform 360Â° while flying. Soon, they approach the castle. Cut to a POV from inside the castle. The Collector and King flies through a curtain and approaches a flight of stairs.]

King: Boy, oh boy. We were gone for a while.

[The Collector and King stops in front of the stairs and jump off the platform, which promptly disappears. They then walk towards the staircase.]

King: I should probably uh, go check on the ol' Owl Beast. Maybe get her something to eat?

[The Collector jumps up and floats mid-air, head facing downwards.]

The Collector: What do mortals eat again? Rocks? Fire? Gravity?

[King looks at The Collector incredulously. Odalia walks down the stairs and approaches the duo.]

Odalia: Welcome home, Collector.

[King and The Collector approaches Odalia.]

Odalia: Did you have a pleasant adventure?

The Collector: Mamadalia, we need to feed the Owl Beast. [lands on the staircase] Hmmm, how about... pizza bagels?

Odalia: [chuckles] I told you before, Collector, I could be much more use to you than being a... Mamadalia. Maybe we can talk about... remaking the Boiling Isles into something bigger and better!

The Collector: [squints unhappily] PI-ZZA BAGELS!

[Odalia grunts, then bows at The Collector. The Collector and King then turn and walk up the stairs, as Odalia also turns around and walks away unhappily.]

The Collector: Oh, and one more thing.

[Odalia immediately tenses up and looks back at The Collector with a nervous expression. The Collector snaps their fingers, summoning the puppets from before out of thin air above Odalia. They then fall down to the ground, causing Odalia to yell out in surprise. Odalia then sits up with an unhappy expression on her face.]

The Collector: Drag those back to the collection room, will ya? K thanks bye!

[Before The Collector finishes his sentence, he floats up together with King, with stars and sparkles surround them.]

[Cut to The Collector's room. It appears to look like the universe with stars and nebula. Two beds can be seen placed on a planet-like structure, which is also floating in the middle of the room. Francois is seen placed on one of the beds. In between the two beds is a nightstand with a lamp on it.]

[The Collector drags King into the room and flies towards the beds.]

The Collector: We've been playing pretend for-ever, King. It is fun, but... [lands on the bed] what if we switch it up? We can play "Capture the Flag"! Us versus... everyone on the Isles! We can put the losers on the moon!

King: [nervously] Wow! That is... an idea. But... don't you think people would have a tough time breathing?

The Collector: So they can hold their breaths.

[The Collector floats up and sinks back down onto his bed, covering themselves with a blanket.]

The Collector: Hey, King!

[The Collector claps. A book made with a large stack of stone slabs falls from above and drops in front of King. King stares up at the tall pile.]

The Collector: Can you read me a sto-ry?

King: [chuckles nervously] Easy.

[King gives the stack a push. It falls backwards, wraps around the planet structure, and stops in front of King. The book then flips open. King walks towards the book and kneels down, preparing to read.]

King: Okay... "Collectors live long, we watch things pass. To preserve, to observe, we must amass. What flies, what swims, be it predator, or prey, seal them up so they may never fade." Uh...

[Cut to a view of the page. Underneath the paragraph, another paragraph says: "But should they meddle in our affairs, we'll clean the planet and scorch the air." But this paragraph has been scratched off by The Collector, and he wrote something underneath it instead.]

The Collector: [panics] NO, NO, NO! Don't read the next part! Skip to where I fixed it.

[Cut back to the page, which now shows what The Collector wrote: "But playing is more fun, make friends instead, and the others stink! Boo!"]

King: Uh, okay. "But playing is more fun, so I'm gonna make friends instead, the others stink, boo!"

[King looks back up at The Collector, who now has their eyes shut with a peaceful look on their face. King climbs up one of the stone slabs to switch the brightness of the lamp to something softer and darker.]

The Collector: King? Can I sleep with Francois? [smiles]

[King looks back at Francois, then back at The Collector.]

King: Come on, you know I've... only let one other person hold him.

The Collector: Right, that human. [sulks] Can you at least leave him to watch over me? I don't like being alone...

[The Collector looks away sadly. King, pitying The Collector, sighs, then puts Francois on the table next to The Collector. The Collector is finally satisfied and smiles, shutting their eyes. King then floats up towards the exit, and after glancing back at The Collector one more time, phases out through the exit.]

[Back at Hexside, Mattholomule led Luz and the rest into the gym. A few students can be seen standing on both sides, wearing masks of Hexside guard and acting as guards.]

[Cut to a banner which says: "NEW HEXSIDE IS THE FUTURE!" Camera then tilts down to reveal Boscha sitting on a tall chair. To her left, a large creature wearing a St. Epiderm uniform, with its face covered by a cloak. To her right, someone unknown with ponytail and glasses, who is also short. Jerbo is standing in front of Boscha holding a clipboard and saying something.]

Jerbo: Uh... so... if... we got a group to... organize supplies, we can keep track of perishables, and... that way, we won't have to... fight over food anymore.

Boscha: [thinks] Hmmm...

[Unknown short person climbs up the chair armrest.]

Unknown short person: President, if I may be so bold.

Luz: [surprised] President?!

Unknown short person: This would take valuable resources away from your guard. You don't want to be "collected" like the others, do you?

Boscha: Good point, Miki. Next! [snaps fingers]

[Jerbo sighs, turns around and walks away. He gasps when he sees Mattholomule and the sextet.]

Jerbo: Oh my gosh, it's you guys!

Mattholomule: Did she take any of our ideas?

Jerbo: [dejected] No, uh... Sorry, I gotta make sure the kindergarteners aren't hunting down lockers again. [mutters and walks away] It was a blood bath last time. [to Luz, waves] So glad you're alive!

[Jerbo forces a laugh and walks off, with Luz and the rest staring at him, Gus flashing a peace sign. Mattholomule walks forward towards Boscha.]

Mattholomule: Uh, Boscha, we found-

[Miki clears her throat.]

Mattholomule: [groans, reluctantly] Allow me to introduce Student Body President Boscha! And her trusted guards, Miki and Roka.

Boscha: Welcome to new Hexside! Home to the future of the Isles and... stuff.

[As Boscha speaks, she plays with a Grudgby ball.]

Luz: What the heck is going on here??

Amity: Yeah, Hexside doesn't even have a student council! I would know, I kept trying to organize one, but Bump thought I was too "obsessed" and-

Willow: Alright girl, take a breath.

[Willow pats Amity on the back. Amity takes a deep breath, then exhales sharply.]

Gus: And who are you two? [points]

Miki: My little sister and I were travelling for the Day of Unity, but found ourselves hiding here after the uh... incident. Boscha brought us in so... we helped to establish order over Hexside.

Boscha: Now, we are flourishing!

[Cut to a view at the gym main entrance. Outside at the corridor, Jerbo and Skara scream and run past. Edric tries to escape, but he can only walk slowly as his whole body is in a cast. The kindergarteners knocks him to the ground as they run past him to chase after Jerbo and Skara. One of the kindergarteners drags Edric away as he screams.]

Edric: Tell my story!!!

[Back to Luz and Camila with a nervous expression on their faces.]

Luz: Well, first of all, I'd like to introduce you to my mama, Camila!

[As Luz speaks, she turns around and places her hand on Camila's arm. Camila then lifts up both her arms and smiles.]

Gus: And [points at Hunter] honorary Hexolio, Hunter!

[Hunter blushes and glares at Gus. Luz strides forward.]

Luz: Long story short, we're here to help. We're gonna rescue everyone from the Archives and SAVE the Boiling Isles!

[A moment of awkward silence follows. One of the guards coughs.]

Luz: ...not the reaction I was expecting.

Miki: [walks forward] As the leader, the safety of Boscha's subjects is paramount. And this is a suicide mission! After the horrors her own grudgby team faced-

Boscha: [agitated] Ugh, quiet! I don't need to hear that again! But... Miki's right. We're staying put.

Luz: But-

Boscha: And that's THAT!

[Cut to Mattholumule and the sextet outside the gym. The guards slam the doors shut behind them. The sextet turn around to look back at the doors, some looking annoyed, some looking puzzled.]

Luz: [puzzled] What just happened??

Mattholomule: It's been like this ever since Miki and Roka showed up! We want to fix stuff around here, but... anytime we suggest something, Miki threatens to throw people into the Detention Pit.

Camila: [shocked] The WHAT?!

Luz: [thinks] Maybe there's another way... I don't know how to get into the Archives, but... we may be able to get close. By teleporting DIRECTLY into the Titan's skull!

[Gus, Willow, Amity, and Camila gasp.]

[Back at The Collector's castle, King walks down a corridor filled with murals on the wall of both sides. His eyes downcast and he looks to be in low spirits. Suddenly, he notices something, gasps, and immediately runs forward. Cut to Odalia kneeling down doing something.]

Odalia: [annoyed] Oh, it's getting tangled.

[Odalia groans and gets up, holding the Hooty puppet in her hands. King calls out to her.]

King: Wait! Wait, can you uh... give me that one?

Odalia: [turns around] Hmm?

[Camera tilts down to show Hooty puppet's face. Cut to King walking down another corridor towards a large cage, carrying puppet Hooty in his arms. Some of the cage's steel bar appears to be bent and broken, and two signs which says "Keep Out!" "Beware of Beast" can be seen placed on the steel bars. In front of the cage, puppets of all Coven Heads except Terra can be seen standing there. To the rightmost of the line-up, Eda can be seen standing there, pretending to be one of the puppets. Suddenly, Eda makes a sound and moves, tongue sticking out.]

King: Eda, come on. Not right now.

[Eda straightens up and looks at puppet Raine next to her. Then, she steps over the laser beam on the floor, which triggers an alarm. All the Coven Head puppets turn around to look at her, then rush forward, all with spell circles drawn, preparing to attack Eda. King panics.]

King: Wait!

[King runs forward and ushers Eda back behind the laser beam. This deactivates the alarm and the puppets, as they all move back to their original position. Cut to King and Eda walking into the cage.]

King: You gotta stop leaving your room! The Collector thinks you are still in Beast mode.

Eda: I know...

[Cut to a view of puppet Raine smiling.]

Eda: I just like visiting Raine.

[Cut to Odalia strenuously trying to drag some puppets down a corridor. She stops, groans, and straightens her back. Right as she bents down to grab the ropes, she notices the Coven Head puppets not far away from her. An idea formed in her mind.]

[Cut to somewhere inside the cage. Lilith is seen stirring a pot of liquid which is being boiled. She now has short red hair. Cut to Eda lifting up a curtain as she walks into the hideout. King follows her behind, carrying puppet Hooty.]

Eda: Lily! Guess who King found!

Lilith: In a moment, Edalyn.

[Lilith grabs a cup and scoops up some liquid from the pot, then gives it to Eda.]

Lilith: Drink this. I think I got it right this time.

[Eda gulps down the drink. The sporadic feathers on her body retracts and disappears.]

Eda: [bleghs] Lily, it's actually impressive how the taste keeps getting worse. But it does work! Keep it up and you'll put Morton out of business.

King: Great! Now, can you do something about this guy?

[King lifts up puppet Hooty by his face. Lilith immediately covers her face and screams in surprise.]

Lilith: Hootsifer! Is he okay? Can he hear me? HOOTSIFER! CAN YOU HEAR ME?

[As Lilith speaks, she kneels down in front of puppet Hooty and lifts him up by his face. Then, nearing the end of sentence, she tears up. A teardrop drips from her face onto Hooty's eye. Immediately, puppet Hooty starts shaking.]

Hooty: Sequestered at a darkness like unto death, the dulcet tones of an angel wakes me. Be it you?? LULU??!!

Lilith: It be, IT BE!

[As she speaks, Lilith cries happy tears and hugs Hooty tightly.]

Eda: Hooty, you keep finding new and impressive ways to creep me out.

[King walks up to Hooty, Lilith, and Eda.]

King: Maybe the Collector can release him too! Like you and Lilith!

Lilith: [firmly] No, you are already putting yourself at enough risk just for us.

Eda: Ah, Lily's right. If The Collector finds out you are lying, we could all turn into puppets for good.

[Eda suddenly feels something.]

Eda: Huh?

[Eda looks down to see King hugging her leg tight.]

Eda: What's the matter?

King: I don't know. I just miss Luz.

Eda: [kneels down] Oh, I miss her too, kiddo. But she's in the Human Realm now with... you know, her real family.

King: Don't say it like that! You know you don't mean it.

[Lilith turns her head around.]

Lilith: What Eda means to say is... we'll find a way to defeat The Collector.

[Lilith lifts Hooty up and looks at his face.]

Lilith: At least Luz and her friends are safe, and far, far away from this madness.

[Cut to an exterior shot of Hexside. It is now dusk and multiple of The Collector's spies are flying around the school building. Cut to inside the building. Gus peeks out from behind a pillar, and uses an illusion to help him look the other way. Suddenly, a fireball flies past him, and he immediately hides. A few rogue kindergarteners run down the corridor holding weapons and shouting.]

Gus: Okay, the coast is clear.

[Gus gives Mattholomule a thumbs up. Mattholomule draws a spell circle on the wall behind him, then slams his hands on it. This activates the spell circle, and the walls split apart, revealing a door behind it. Mattholomule then leads everyone into the Photo class room.]

Mattholomule: This, is where me and Jerbo had been trying to come up with plans to make Hexside more livable.

[Willow notices a notice board with several photos pinned on it. She sees a family photo of hers, and immediately tears up, becoming sad. She then shuts her eyes and shakes her head.]

Willow: Keep it in, keep it in! [opens eyes and looks down] Oh!

[Willow notices a photo of Hunter holding his staff. He is in his Flyer Deby attire and is grinning at Flapjack happily. She turns around to look at Hunter, who is still upset and annoyed. She then takes down the photo and smiles at it.]

Gus: Plans to convert the gym into a common space? Schedules for rotating guard shifts? [gasps] Is that a dinner menu using veges from the Plant Homeroom?? Mattholomule, you are actually a decent leader!

Mattholomule: Did you ever have any [flicks his hair] doubt in your mind?

Gus: Yes. Many many doubts.

[Cut to Luz walking over to a chair to sit down.]

Luz: Alright. [to Willow] Time to take a walk down memory lane.

[Willow grabs a pair of tweezers.]

Luz: Once, I saw Philip- I mean, Belos, use a glyph to teleport to the skull. But... it may take some digging to find it.

[Hearing Luz's words, Camila becomes worried. Amity glances over at Camila. Willow places a hand on Luz's shoulder as she speaks.]

Willow: Remember, Luz. No schemes, no plots, no ruses.

Willow and Luz: [together] And definitely no shenanigans.

[Both Willow and Luz smile. Willow holds up the tweezers.]

Camila: ...I'm gonna assume those are clean.

[Back at Belos' hideout, the hand sticking out from dirt earlier is still twitching, as the tubes connecting from somewhere into the dirt keeps on flashing blue lights. Suddenly, the hand sinks down, and Belos emerges from the dirt. Based on the shadows on the wall, he should be a grimwalker who looks like Hunter. Belos moans and lifts up his hand, and the skin melts right off.]

Belos: No.

[Belos balls up his fist.]

Belos: It's not ready.

[Belos quickly runs off on all fours while screeching. Cut to him climbing up the horn of the Titan, approaching the Archives. Eventually, he makes it to the building, and climbs through a window. He sees Odalia ordering puppet Raine to carry the puppets around.]

Odalia: Put that one over there. No, no, no, over there!

[Puppet Raine turns and walks towards the direction Odalia is pointing, carrying puppet Amelia in their arms.]

Odalia: [sighs frustratedly] Making a deal with that child was a waste of time! I wish someone would see my potential.

Belos: Oh yes, I think you'll prove to be quite useful.

[Belos emerges from behind Odalia and towers over her as he speaks. Odalia turns her head around nervously.]

Odalia: [points at herself] Me?

Belos: No.

[Belos screeches and launches himself forward, going past a shocked Odalia and towards puppet Raine.]

Belos: You!

[Belos plunges himself into puppet Raine. Soon, he gains control over puppet Raine's body. They lift up their head and looks at the camera, eyes flashing blue and cackling.]

[Back at the Photo class room, Luz's memories have been taken out and clipped on a clothesline with clothespins. They are memories from moments when she arrived at the Boiling Isles all the way to the Day of Unity. Willow places another memory she just took out on the clothesline, which shows Luz trying to fight Grom, who has taken the form of Camila. Camila stares at the photo.]

Willow: I think we found it.

[Camila turns her head around, a worried expression on her face. Willow takes out another photo from Luz's ear, which shows the moment when Luz and Lilith look down at the teleportation glyph Philip had just drawn on the ground.]

Luz: Whoa, it's so clear! We can use this to get to the skull!

Hunter: [annoyedly] Finally. [stands up] We can get moving again.

[Willow stops Hunter in his tracks.]

Willow: Before we go... Look what I found.

[Willow offers the photo she found earlier to Hunter. He takes it over and looks at it.]

Gus: We're all gonna miss Flapjack, but... we know he loved you the most.

Willow: And we just wanna let you know, we don't care who you're supposed to be. â€˜cause you are one of us now. Never forget that.

[Hunter looks up from the photo, teary-eyed and sad. Gus and Willow are taken aback.]

Luz: Hunter, are you okay?

[As Luz speaks, she puts on her witch hat.]

Hunter: I... don't know.

[Hunter looks back down at the photo. Willow becomes overwhelmed with guilt.]

Willow: Oh, um... I'm... sorry, I... [retreats backwards] didn't mean to make things worse.

[Vines emerge from the ground and wraps around Willow's feet.]

Willow: I, uh... I'll be right back.

[Willow walks off, breaking the vines. She then opens the classroom door and walks out.]

Gus: [sighs] I guess this is my fault too.

Hunter: [perplexed] What? How?

Gus: I've known you were a grimwalker since the Day of Unity. I was waiting for you to bring it up yourself but... I... I- I don't know. Maybe if I weren't so afraid, none of us would be hurting right now.

[As Gus speaks, he takes out a photo of a close-up shot of the face of Caleb Wittebane's statue in Gravesfield.]

Hunter: Gus, I- I...

Gus: It's okay. You stay here, I'll find Willow.

[Gus rushes out from the classroom.]

Hunter: Wait, Gus!

[Cut to Willow storming down the school hallway, looking angry. Behind her, Hunter calls out to her and Gus.]

Hunter: Willow! Gus! Wait up, please!

[Willow walks past Boscha.]

Boscha: Trouble with your team, Captain Half-a-witch?

[Hearing Boscha, Willow stops dead in her tracks.]

Boscha: Leading isn't easy, is it? All your time is spent helping the team. Keeping people from fighting. Planning your next move. And Titan forbid YOU show any weakness! Everyone else falls apart.

Willow: Not now, Boscha.

Boscha: If you want my advice...

Willow: Advice? From you? [turns around to face Boscha] You have been nothing but petty and mean to me since I met you! What, you want me to give up? You want me to admit how stressed I am? What advice could you possibly give me?!

[As Willow speaks, she becomes more and more angrier. Near the end of her sentence, her eyes start glowing and vines emerge from the ground around her. Boscha is initially shocked at Willow's reaction, but immediately changes back to her usual demeanor.]

Boscha: Actually, I was gonna advice you to watch your back.

[Boscha pulls up a face cover. Willow turns around to look behind her.]

Boscha: You never know when your opponent is gonna strike.

[Cut to Camila, Amity, Luz, and Mattholomule in the Photo class room.]

Mattholomule: Woof! They're not coming back, are they?

[Camila shuts her eyes and bows down her head.]

Camila: You kids have gone through too much. Even when we rescue your families, there're still so much to fix.

Amity: [gloomily] At least we'll all be together to figure it out. Right, Luz? [smiles]

[Luz stares at Amity with a guilty expression.]

Luz: Amity... I should tell you something.

[Something suddenly barges through the wall, catching everyone by surprise. Miki walks in together with Roka.]

Miki: Ha! So the rumours were true. You were trying to stage a coup, little Mattholumule!

Mattholomule: Yeah! We were! â€˜cause you guys are the worst!

[Miki starts cackling evilly. Luz suddenly realizes who she really is.]

Luz: [incredulously] No!!! Not you!

[Miki cackles and pulls the cover off Roka, removing her wig and glasses in the process, revealing herself as Kikimora and Roka as her Abomatron.]

Kikimora: Long time no see, human.

Luz: Kikimora!

Camila: [sniffs] What's that smell?

Luz: [sniffs] Sleeping nettles!

[Boscha laughs and walks into the room, stopping next to the Abomatron. She's holding a potion bottle with a potion laced with sleeping nettles, which also produced smoke.]

Boscha: Most important rule of Grudgby: "Always expect the unexpected".

[After inhaling the smoke from the potion, Camila, Amity, Luz, and Mattholomule become dizzy and drop to the ground. The last thing Luz sees before fainting is Kikimora cackling evilly as she puts on a face cover.]

[Back at The Collector's castle, Belos walks down a corridor using puppet Raine's body. A bit of his goo flows out from the eye and rolls down their cheek, and Belos promptly flicks it off. Cut to The Collector's bedroom. Belos opens the door and floats down, standing next to The Collector's bed. He opens his palm and releases some goo from it, intending to harm The Collector. The Collector's eyes suddenly shoots open in alert, and they immediately fling their blanket towards Belos, wrapping him around with it and immobilizing him.]

The Collector: You're not supposed to move on your own! How did you break your spell?

Belos-Raine: The spell isn't broken.

[Belos lifts up his hair and shows The Collector the crescent moon symbol on his forehead.]

Belos-Raine: See? You take such good care of us Coven Heads, Collector, keeping us safe in the Archives. It was the uh... power of your kindness that brought me to life, so I could tell you-

The Collector: What is it?!

Belos-Raine: You're in danger, Collector.

[From the reflection in Belos' glasses, the expression of The Collector changes from angry to puzzled.]

[Back at Hexside, the door to the Detention pit opens up. Kikimora walks over in her Abomatron, and drops Luz, Amity, Camila, and Mattholomule into the pit, who were wrapped in a ball of Abomination goo.]

Luz: [angrily] What gives, Kikimora? Are you working for The Collector?

Kikimora: The days of Kikimora the underling are over. I prefer partnership such as ours. We need to establish our rule now, for the well-being of future generations.

[As Kikimora speaks, she gestures towards Boscha, who walks over and stares down at the quartet.]

Camila: Okay, I'm still catching up. What's the little red kitten trying to do?

[To the left, Mattholomule blows a raspberry at Kikimora as Camila speaks.]

Luz: She's just copying Belos' "scare people into worship" thing because she has NO IDEAS OF HER OWN!

[Kikimora rubs her right fist on her left palm.]

Kikimora: Oh, I'm going to enjoy this!

[Kikimora jumps into the pit.]

Kikimora: You think I'd just drop you in and walk away? No, I think I'll take you out myself!

[As she speaks, Kikimora aims the cannon muzzle of the Abomatron at Luz.]

Amity: Boscha, come on!

[Luz stands up and shields everyone behind her.]

Amity: This is a bit much, even for you!

[Boscha glances to her side, then turns around and walks away, closing the Detention pit door behind her. Kikimora fires up her cannon, then fires at Luz. However, Luz is able to stop it with vines from a Plant glyph. She then runs off, and Amity proceeds to attack Kikimora by summoning Abomination goo. Kikimora catches the goo with the Abomatron's hand, then prepares to fire it back. Amity gasps and pushes Camila aside, both falling to the ground. Mattholomule attempts to fight, but the pile of goo easily buries him underneath it. He pops out from the goo.]

Mattholomule: Ah! I don't deserve this!

[Kikimora attempts to pull off the vines wrapping around her cannon, but more vines emerge from above and wraps around her Abomatron. Up above, Luz has activated more Plant glyphs, as is trying to hold on for dear life.]

Camila: I- I- I- I think I remember the Ice glyph!

[As she speaks, Camila grabs a bone from the ground.]

Luz: Mama, wait!

[Camila draws the Ice glyph on the ground, and slams her hand onto it, activating the glyph. A large piece of ice block shoots up and hits the pit door, destroying it. Rocks and rubble start falling all around the Detention pit. Kikimora shields herself with the Abomatron's arm. Amity wraps herself and Mattholomule in a ball of Abomination goo and rolls away. Luz pounces towards Camila and pushes her backwards before the falling stones hit both of them. One the smoke disperses, Luz sits up.]

Luz: Mama? Amity?

[Kikimora emerges from a pile of rubble behind Luz.]

Kikimora: Don't think you've won just yet!

Camila: Kiki-miki!

[Kikimora looks towards Camila, who is somewhere above.]

Camila: Uh... [grabs her bat] bruja toss!

[Camila kisses her bat, then throws it towards Kikimora, hitting her right in the head and knocking her out. Camila then runs away with Luz, picking up her bat from the ground on the way.]

[At another part of the Detention pit, Amity and Mattholomule are searching for everyone.]

Amity: Luz? Camila! Are you okay?

[Boscha suddenly lands in front of the duo, causing them to gasp in shock. Boscha then stands up and stares at them.]

Amity: [sternly] Let us go, Boscha.

Boscha: Oh, Amity. I already let you go. Many times. When you stop hanging out with the group, when you left the grudgby team, when you disappeared for months!

Amity: What are you saying?

Boscha: I'm saying...

[Boscha walks up to Amity and gets really close to her face. Suddenly, she grabs Amity's hand and kneels down.]

Boscha: Please come back!

Mattholomule: Huh?

Amity: Eh?

Boscha: The others are gone, but... we can still be a team! We can rule New Hexside together. It'll be just like the old days! And maybe even better!

[Amity and Mattholomule stare at each other uncertainly. Suddenly, something tumbles above them, making a loud noise and causing the ground to shake.]

Amity: Sorry, we don't have time for this.

[Amity walks away with Mattholomule, leaving Boscha behind. Boscha then proceeds to hug Amity tight from behind, stopping her.]

Boscha: I won't let you leave again!

Amity: Boscha, you're hurting me!

[Suddenly, the duo are surprised by the sound of spell circles being activated. A shoddily made stone statue then emerges from the ground between them, separating them apart.]

Mattholomule: Run!

[Mattholomule slams a spell circle into the ground, creating some smoke, then runs away with Amity. Angered by this, Boscha kicks the head of the statue towards the duo. Mattholomule activates a spell circle, and puts on Abomination gloves to catch the head. He then throws it back at Boscha, but she dodges it. Boscha then throws a bottle of potion at Mattholomule, then summons her staff and runs forward. The potion hits Mattholomule, but he was able to shield it with his Abomination gloves. Boscha then pushes him aside with her staff and grabs Amity by her arms.]

Boscha: Got you now, Blight!

[All of a sudden, a puff of smoke appears. Once it disperses, Boscha realizes that she is actually grabbing Mattholomule instead of Amity, and backs off.]

Boscha: Huh??

Mattholomule: Cool, right? A little illusion trick Augustus taught me.

Boscha: But... [backs away] Where's Amity? She didn't leave, did she?

[Behind Boscha, another puff of smoke appears, and she turns around to look at it. Once the smoke disperses, Amity is seen sitting on the shoulder of a large Abomination.]

Amity: I can't be who you want me to be, Boscha. But we can still save your teammates. Would you let us try?

[Boscha starts sweating as she is forced to make a decision.]

[Somewhere else in the Detention pit, Hunter desperately tries to wake Gus up by grabbing him by the collar.]

Hunter: Hey, Gus! Gus, Gus, are you okay? Can you hear me? Gus, wake up!

[Gus wakes up and squints at Hunter confusedly.]

Gus: Huh? What? Ah! Boscha!

[As Gus speaks, he pushes Hunter aside and runs off.]

Hunter: It's okay! It's okay, it's just me.

[Gus crosses his arms, looks to his right, then looks back at Hunter.]

Gus: What... happened? I remember smelling sleeping nettles.

Hunter: Yeah, and... I think I saw Kikimora, which is definitely a bad sign. [points to his left] That way is all caved in so-

[Gus turns around towards the opposite direction.]

Gus: This way. Yeah. I'm ready to kick some new Hexside butt.

[Hunter stares as Gus walks away. He then hugs his hands around his knees and buries his head in his arms as he speaks.]

Hunter: Oh, Flapjack... Everyone's on edge and I don't know what to say. I wish you were here.

[A vine emerges from the ground and wraps around Hunter's left arm. Hunter notices this and breaks it off.]

Hunter: Huh?

[More vines emerge and wrap around Hunter's arms. Suddenly, Gus cries out in surprise. Hunter immediately stands up and runs towards the sound's direction.]

Hunter: Gus!

[Hunter notices something and gasps, stopping in his tracks. In front of him, Gus is tightly wrapped in vines, hanging upside town and looking terrified. On the ground, Willow is wrapped in vines too. She turns around to look at Hunter, eyes glowing green.]

Willow: Oh, Hunter!

[Willow pulls up her left arm and breaks the vines, then starts to draw a spell circle.]

Willow: I had a little run-in with Boscha and got stuck down here. Gus just... surprised me.

Hunter: What's going on? [rushes forward]

Willow: I've got it all under control.

[Willow tries to free Gus, but more vibes appear and wraps him around tight instead.]

Gus: Uh, I don't think it's working!

[Gus tries to mutter something, but he's now completely wrapped up in vines, much to Willow's dismay.]

Willow: I can do this. I can do this. I can do this! I can do this... I can do this...!

[As she speaks, Willow frantically tries to pull away the vines on the ground, but more vines start to appear all around her. Hunter tries to approach her, but he's promptly wrapped up in vines too. Willow suddenly notices that Hunter is gone too and becomes scared.]

Willow: Hello...?

[Only Willow is left in the place and there are vines all around her.]

[Back in The Collector's bedroom, Belos (in Raine's puppet body) and TCollector stares down at each other. Suddenly, the Collector bursts out laughing and does a backflip in the air.]

The Collector: Me? I'm in danger?

[The Collector keeps on laughing and floats back down to his bed. Belos follow him suit.]

The Collector: Ah, good one.

Belos-Raine: It's true. Someone very close to you is planning their betrayal, right- now.

[As Belos speaks, he unwraps the blanket and hands it back to The Collector.]

The Collector: [nonchalantly] You don't mean King, right? I don't know if you've noticed, but... he's my best friend.

Belos-Raine: And... where is he now?

[The Collector thinks, then looks towards Francois with a hesitant expression on his face.]

[At Eda and Lilith's hideout, a pair of eyes appear on the wall as The Colllector spies on King. Cut to a scroll depicting a Titan using sonic scream powers to kill off a Collector. Cut to a view of the room, King is starring at the scroll, Eda is sitting next to Lilith, and Lilith reads from a book as she speaks, hugging puppet Hooty with her left arm.]

Lilith: Alright, King. According to these uh... borrowed books, Titan magic can actually cancel out the Collector's. And that's why his predecessors... Well, uh...

King: Wiped out all the Titans?

Lilith: The important thing is that there is hope to defeat him. Maybe even trap him again.

King: No! We can't do that!

[Back at The Collector's room, after hearing what King just said, The Collector takes off his hood.]

Collector: Hear that? He's looking out for me.

[Belos stares at The Collector.]

Eda: Why not?

King: â€˜cause it didn't work!

[Upon hearing that, The Collector immediately pulls down his hood at spies on King again. Cut to King at the hideout.]

King: If we want things to go back to normal, The Collector needs to be stopped for good! And I think I know a more permanent solution.

[Back at The Collector's room, he becomes uneasy as he takes off his hood.]

The Collector: That didn't sound... very friendly.

[As The Collector speaks, he becomes sadder and hugs his knees with his arms.]

Belos-Raine: You know, the human is here too.

The Collector: [gets mad] Luz? Why is she back?

Belos-Raine: Obviously, to help King put an end to you. [walks away] And your little games.

The Collector: [furiously] No! [stands up] No, no, no! You're fibbing, you're definitely fibbing!

[The Collector becomes uncertain.]

The Collector: ...right?

[Belos looks back at the Collector without turning his head, and smirks. Cut back to King at the hideout.]

King: The Collector is just a little kid. A scary, powerful one, but... also... sad, and alone. I don't know, this whole time, I was scared of making him mad, but... I think I can relate to him.

[Eda smiles at King. King walks towards her.]

King: Let me talk to him. Immortal being to semi-immortal being. It's worth a try if no more people get hurt. Right?

[Eda pulls King closer into a hug.]

Eda: Oh, you're growing up too fast for me, kiddo. [kisses King on the head]

[Back at somewhere outside, a few of The Collector's spies fly past above. Camera tilts down to show a stone wall. The wall suddenly breaks open, and someone invisible runs out and away from the cave, stepping on grass along the way. Then, a powerful blast shoots out from the hole, and destroys everything around. Cut to Kikimora on her Abomatron, with the cannon just recently fired. She's getting furious as she controls her Abomatron to move forward.]

Kikimora: Come on out, you humans.

[Kikimora stomps down the blasted path.]

Kikimora: [taunting] You can't hide forever!

[Once Kikimora is far away enough, camera tilts down and shows Luz and Camila cancelling out the Invisibility glyph. They both take deep breaths, and exhales, with Camila dropping her knees onto the ground. Luz becomes extremely frustrated.]

Luz: [screams in anger] My whole plan fell apart, I- I messed up again!

[As Luz speaks, she takes off her hat and throws it aside. Camila looks as the hat lands nearby.]

Camila: What are you talking about?

Luz: [sighs] It doesn't matter.

[Luz starts walking away, but Camila grabs her hand.]

Camila: No, mija. It does matter.

[Camila pulls Luz back down to the ground.]

Camila: You don't want to leave the Demon Realm, do you?

Luz: Of course not! But...

Camila: You keep messing up? Messing up is a part of living! You don't think I've ever messed up before? Ha! Okay, well, once I scheduled my wisdom tooth surgery the day before my wedding. Oh, then there was that time I got road rage and didn't realize I was cursing out your new principal. And, you know, I sold energy drinks for a pyramid scheme for 3 years! And of course, I was convinced we should move to Gravesfield to be closer to that fancy hospital. You know how that ended.

[When it comes to the part about Manny, Camila becomes sad and tears up. Luz tears up as well as she looks at Camila, then looks away. Suddenly, she hears Kikimora blasting from somewhere above.]

Camila: And worst of all, I didn't stand up for you when you needed me most. [sniffles] I forgot about the Astral Oath.

[As Camila speaks, tears start rolling down her cheeks, and she wipes it off. Luz becomes surprised when she hears the last part, and looks over at Camila.]

Luz: The what?

Camila: The Astral Oath is a promise made between Captain Avery and his family, to love and protect each other just as they are... Through supernovas, and solar winds.

[As Camila speaks, she walks over to Luz's hat and picks it back up.]

Luz: Mom... are you a secret nerd?

[Luz looks up at Camila adoringly and smiles. Camila walks back to her, holding the hat in her hand.]

Camila: I had a hard time growing up. I was afraid you would too. My biggest mistake was trying to protect you, by changing this beautiful Good Witch into something she wasn't.

[As Camila speaks, she puts the hat back on Luz's head and caresses her cheek. Luz becomes touched and starts sobbing. Inside her waist pouch, her Palisman egg starts glowing. Luz wipes off her tears without noticing it.]

Luz: I think I just... realized something.

[The Palisman egg starts to crack.]

Luz: I don't know why it took me so long to figure out.

[The Palisman egg cracks further. Camila stares at Luz and smiles.]

Luz: The only thing I've ever really wanted...

[The Palisman egg's glow becomes bright enough that it grabs Camila's attention. Luz however, still didn't notice this.]

Luz: ...was to be understood!

[As Luz speaks, she lifts up her head, teary-eyed, finally having a moment of epiphany. Beams of purple light emerges from the crack on the Palisman egg, which then explodes, creating a force field so powerful and bright that it shoots up straight into the sky. Kikimora notices the bright purple flash behind her, and turns around to look at it. She then grins evilly.]

[After the blinding flash fades, Luz opens her eyes, sees something and gasps. In front of her, her staff floats in the air, with sparkles and clouds (?) spiraling around the Palisman. The Palisman itself is also shrouded by the mass of clouds. Luz approaches her staff as the staff also floats down to her. She grabs the staff, sending an energy field upwards. Camila then approaches as the duo look at the shrouded mass atop the staff in awe. The cloud stops rotating, and becomes a purple orb. Suddenly, Kikimora bursts through the wall behind them.]

Kikimora: Found you!

[Back at the Detention pit, Willow is still alone in the dark surrounded by vines. She's nervous.]

Willow: Gus? Hunter?

[Behind Willow, Gus grunts in response, only his hand sticking out as the rest of his body is still wrapped up in vines.]

Willow: [turns around] Gus!

[Willow desperately tries to pull off the vines.]

Willow: I can do this. I can do this!

[Willow draws a spell circle, but it summons more vines instead, causing her to scream in surprise. Somewhere behind Willow, Hunter, who is also wrapped up in vines, opens his eyes and stares at Willow.]

Willow: [crying tone] I can do this! I can do this... I can't do this.

[Willow drops to her knees as vines emerge from the ground around her.]

Willow: I can't control my own magic. I can't help my friends. Ugh, why have I been trying to be someone different? Boscha's right, I'll always just be... half-a-witch Willow.

[As Willow speaks, the vines start to wrap around her, eventually completely concealing her. Hunter tears up as he sees this happening. Suddenly, his entire body starts to glow a bright yellow, and he balls up his fist. And then, with a scream, he breaks free from the vines and teleports forward, crashing through the vines Willow's been wrapped in and brings her out.]

Hunter: [teary-eyed] You didn't make anything worse, you didn't do anything wrong! You guys mean the world to me, and I... I didn't know how to say that yet. Just please don't call yourself that ever again. You've been holding in a lot, haven't you?

[Willow stares at Hunter with a surprised expression, eyes still glowing green.]

Gus: Willow!

[Tears start to flow down Willow's cheeks as she and Hunter looks towards Gus.]

Gus: Reliable people need someone to rely on too!

[Gus gets wrapped up in vines again.]

Gus: [muffled] Just let it out, we'll be fine! [thumbs up]

[Willow starts sobbing.]

Willow: I miss my dads...

[The entire ground starts to shake as Willow starts bawling. Hunter looks at the vines crashing down all around them with a stupefied expression on his face. One of Gus' illusions then pops up. Hunter turns around to look at it.]

Gus' illusion: Hey! [points to his left]

[Hunter grabs Willow by the shoulder and teleports over to Gus. He then grabs Gus and teleports away before a large rock crashes into where Gus was at. Hunter then teleports and moves upwards in a zig-zag pattern, until the trio finally gets out of the cave. However, they stopped mid-air, so they all fall towards the ground screaming. They then roll down a slope, before coming to a stop. The trio then pants.]

Gus: [sits up] Hunter, how did you do that?

[As Gus speaks, both him and Willow looks towards Hunter.]

Hunter: [rubs his eye] Do what?

Gus: [happily] You have magic, dude!

Hunter: The... magic of friendship?

Willow: No! The magic of FLAPJACK!

[Willow places her hand on Hunter's chest. Hunter chokes up. He suddenly notices a bright purple flash to his right, and immediately teleports away with Gus and Willow. A bright purple force field passes right behind Hunter. Cut to the trio looking at where the force field came from.]

Hunter, Willow, and Gus: Huh?

[Cut to a shot of the purple orb atop Luz's staff. Camera zooms out to show Camila and Luz. Luz is sitting on the ground.]

Luz: Sorry! [laughs] I'm still getting the hang of this.

Gus: [unbelievably] Luz has a staff.

Willow: Why does that make me nervous?

[Somewhere nearby, Kikimora pushes aside two trees with the Abomatron.]

Kikimora: [angrily] There you are! I'm done playing hide-and-seek!

[Kikimora aims her cannon at Luz and fires. Willow immediately summons vines from the ground and surfs forward, blocking the attack from Kikimora with the vines. She then draws a spell circle.]

Willow: Yep, that's better.

[With her magic powers, Willow commands the trees to fall and crash towards Kikimora's Abomatron. She then uses a vine to grab the Abomatron's left hand, and slaps Kikimora with it. Furiously, Kikimora fires her cannon at Willow, but missed. Luz and Hunter gasp.]

Gus: She's fine. This is child's play for us.

[As he speaks, Gus creates more spell circles in between his hands. He uses it to create 3 illusions of Willow flying. Kikimora fires at 2 of them, destroying both.]

Luz: Whoa, what did I miss?

[Willow draws a spell circle as she flies on her staff, but some Abomination goo fired by Kikimora hits her, knocking her off her staff. She screams as she starts falling. Hunter immediately teleports upwards and catches Willow with his arms. After landing, Willow blushes as her and Hunter stare at each other.]

Luz: [angrily] I missed a lot!

[Kikimora approaches the quintet.]

Kikimora: I don't need this wretched school to start my own empire. I'll make my own! And I'll start by taking you apart, piece by piece, brat by brat!

[As Kikimora speaks, she stomps towards the quintet as they brace themselves for a fight. Two fiery grudgby balls suddenly hit Kikimora, and she turns to her left angrily. On a cliff nearby, a group of Hexside students stare down at Kikimora angrily, some holding fiery grudgby balls in their hands. They are holding a banner which says H.A.S., which is short for Human Appreciation Society.]

Mattholomule: Stop right there! Miki, I can't say I'm surprised by this. As for you, Roka...

[The Abomatron points at itself questioningly.]

Mattholomule: I know there's been nothing but [flicks his hair] chemistry between us. Be that as it may, [lifts up a fiery grudgby ball] I-

Boscha: That's a robot, Matt.

[Mattholomule shrugs. The Hexside students then proceed to hurl fiery grudgby balls at Kikimora. Cut to Amity flying towards Luz and the rest.]

Amity: They'll hold her back. [grabs Luz's hand and runs] Let's get to the skull!

[The others immediately run after Luz and Amity.]

Willow: Hey, Boscha. Don't think this means I'm finish with you. [grins]

[Boscha lifts up a fiery grudgby ball.]

Boscha: Whatever. I didn't do this for any of you. I just want to do normal things, and look great, and play grudgby with MY TEAM!

[Near the end of her sentence, Boscha jumps down the cliff along with the other Hexside students, some of them holding fiery grudgby balls. Cut to Willow running away as the Hexside students pounces towards Kikimora, pushing her Abomatron to the ground. Cut to Luz suddenly stopping as the others continue running towards the skull, and takes out the photo taken from her head earlier to memorize the teleportation glyph combo. She then keeps the photo and starts drawing the glyph combo on the ground, but before she can finish, the orb glows, and the staff starts flying, much to Luz's delight.]

Luz: I can't tell what you're gonna be, but... thank you, little friend!

[Luz continues drawing the glyph combo on the ground while flying on the staff. Upon seeing this, Amity, Gus, and Willow summon their staffs and use it to help with drawing the glyph combo. Soon, the drawing is finished.]

[Cut to the Hexside students trying to hold Kikimora and her Abomatron down. She eventually stands up and throws everyone aside as she speaks.]

Kikimora: This is my empire now! [stomps forward] You have to obey ME!

[Kikimora fires from her cannon towards Luz and rest. Upon seeing that, Luz immediately slams oth her hands onto the glyph, activating it. The glyph combo successfully teleports everyone away to the skull before Kikimora's fireball hits them.]

[Cut to somewhere inside the skull. Everyone except Luz is shown on screen as they keep their eyes shut tight. Eventually, Camila and Hunter open their eyes and look above in surprise. Part of the Archives can be seen floating above. Cut to a POV from somewhere further to show the sextet on a half-sphere like structure.]

Gus: We... we made it!

Willow: [ecstatically] Oh my gosh! [screams happily]

[Willow and Amity lean towards each other. Amity laughs happily.]

Willow: I can't believe that actually worked!

[Amity and Willow run off together joyously. Camila approaches Hunter.]

Camila: [chortles] Well you really beamed us up, eh, O'Bailey?

[As Camila speaks, she playfully elbows Hunter. Both Hunter and Gus gasp at Camila's mention of Chief O'Bailey from "Cosmic Frontier". Cut to Luz starring up at her Palisman, which is still shrouded in a colourful mist. She then grabs her staff.]

Hunter and Gus: [background, chanting] Beam us up! Beam us up! Beam us up!

[Luz stares at the spiraling mist in awe.]

Luz: Guys?

[Cut to the quintet. Gus and Hunter and laughing happily. Everyone soon notices what's happening to Luz's Palisman and gasps.]

Luz: Come meet my Palisman!

[Everyone approaches the staff.]

Camila: [excited] What kind of magical creature will it be? A dragon?

Hunter: A bird?

Amity: Oh, an otter!

Willow: A spooky bat?

Gus: A... snake?

Luz: You are close. [smiles]

[A serpent like creature flies out from the mist and transforms itself into a bat, then a scorpion, then a dragon, before reverting back to its true form: A cat-snake like creature.]

Luz: She's a snake shifter! Her name is Stringbean, and she's PERFECT!

[Stringbean flies down to Luz's palm as she speaks. She rubs herself On Luz's face as Luz caresses her. Stringbean then flies towards Amity, Willow and Gus, much to their delight. Ghost, Clover, and Emmiline follow behind Stringbean as she flies off. Camila runs over to the Palismen.]

Camila: Â¡Pero mira que preciosos mis bebÃ©s! Â¡Ven, ven! (Translation: Oh look at all of mama's precious babies. Come here, come here.)

[Camila kneels down in front of the palismen as she speaks. The palismen then approach Camila, and she holds Stringbean and Clover close to her cheeks.]

[Hunter smiles as he sees this, but is surprised when someone suddenly grabs his hand. He looks to his right and sees Willow next to him.]

Willow: Thanks for what you said back there. [smiles at Hunter] You mean a lot to me too.

[Hunter immediately blushes. He also starts tearing up and sniffles. Willow also blushes at Hunter. Cut to Willow and Hunter holding each other's pinky fingers.]

Hunter: Cool. Happy to help.

[The duo stick their hand together as Hunter speaks.]

[Stringbean flies back to Luz as Amity also approaches Luz. Stringbean rubs Luz on the face, causing her to grin happily. Noticing Amity in front of her, Luz turns Stringbean into her staff form.]

Luz: Can't wait to show Eda and King.

[Luz holds Amity's hand as she speaks.]

Amity: They'll love her. Although Hooty might eat her.

Luz: King might too.

Amity: Eda might three.

[Luz and Amity stare at each other, then burst out laughing together.]

[Cut to a POV from further away. The camera tilts up, showing The Collector sitting on the edge of a cliff staring down at the sextet. Belos stands behind him. He then approaches The Collector.]

Belos-Raine: What did I tell you? [leans down] Luz has come to help King get rid of you for good. What will you do, Collector?

[The Collector becomes angry. His eyes start glowing as he floats up. He then stops.]

The Collector: I think I wanna play a new game.

The Collector: But-- But you said. You said you'd let me out! [Whining.] I hate it here!

Belos: Just a little longer. We have to wait 'till after the Draining Spell.

[King floats over to the source of the voices and watches them from behind a pillar. The Collector is trapped in a mysterious floating orb, while Belos is speaking from a small round piece of glass floating nearby.]

The Collector: [Assertive.] You better not be fibbing. You pinky-swore me.

Emperor Belos: Patience, Collector, you can trust me. [King scoffs at this.]

The Collector: Hm? Who's there?!

[King wakes up in Willow's lap, breathing heavily.]

Willow: [Calmly.] It's okay, King, it's okay.

[King, Willow, Alador, Amity, Gus, and Hunter are all aboard the airship from last episode. Amity is worriedly pacing back and forth, Gus is inspecting his power amplifier, and three of the gang's palismen are huddled in a shaking pile. Hunter does various adjustments to the air ship to help steer it.]

Alador: [Irritated.] I know how to fly a ship.

Amity: [Frantic.] Then fly faster! We're barely halfway there. Luz could be in trouble!

Hunter: Maybe if I took the wheel...

Alador: [Suspiciously.] Very eager to return to Belos, eh, Golden Guard?

Hunter: At least I've never built him an army!

Alador: [Angrily.] Watch your tone with me, young man.

[Alador lets go of the steering wheel, causing the ship to tilt and Gus to fall out of his seat.]

Gus: [Annoyed.] Hey, here's a bright idea: don't distract the pilot!

Hunter: He started it!

[Alador, Hunter, Gus, and Amity all start yelling at each other angrily. King and Willow watch sadly from the back of the ship.]

King: I can't believe she's gonna face Belos alone again. And I'm powerless to help her. We can't even manage to help each other.

[Willow lifts up Clover, and nods to her. Clover chirps and flies over to where the other palismen are. The palismen push a box of cheeses, bread, and apples over to the arguing witches, interrupting their fighting. Gus' stomach growls.]

Ghost: Meow!

Amity: Look, we're all exhausted and terrified. Let's focus our energy on helping Luz instead of fighting each other.

[Everyone nods. They all take a snack from the box. Gus fist bumps Hunter as an apology. Alador then gestures Hunter to steer the wheel with a sincere smile. To the side, Amity is rubbing her hands together from the cold, but Alador summons Abomination goo to cover her hands. He sits down next to her.]

Amity: Hmm? Aw, this is just like when I was a kid. [Realizes something.] Wait. Is this why you call me "Mittens"? [Alador just smiles at her and eats his bread.]

King: That was amazing!

Willow: [Clover flies back to her hand.] There's always a way to help. You just have to look for the right opportunity.

King: Thanks, Willow. I'll... [Yawns.] ...remember that.

[He lies down to go back to sleep.]

-THEME SONG, but with only the title screen and no music-

[Cut to outside the Titan's head. The moon and sun are nearing an eclipse. All Coven witches from across the isles have gathered into a large, circular area. Belos appears on top of a raised platform in the center, and the crowd gasps. Belos grins deviously, then projects a larger version of himself. Everyone starts cheering.]

Belos: Children of the Isles! For too long, our world has been home to an insidious pox. A corruption that defiles the Titan's blessings. But today, that changes. [Reaches toward the sun and moon.] United with the Titan, and the power of the eclipse, we shall wipe out wild magic forever. Paradise awaits!

[Belos's projection fades out, and six of the Coven Heads walk out onto the central platform. Raine, Eda, Lilith, and Hooty (the latter three have just canceled out their invisibility glyph) are hiding in a small hollowed-out area nearby. Lilith looks down to see Katya and Derwin disguised as Coven Scouts guarding the area, and Katya gives her a thumbs-up.]

Eda: Whoo! [Stretches, detaching and reattaching her arm by accident.] That last stretch was a long one.

Raine: [Worried.] Hey, pay attention. The other Coven Heads think they're gonna be royalty after today. And they'll do anything to make that happen. The cloaking stone won't cover your voice, so make sure not to speak. Also--

Eda: [Grabs Raine by the shoulders.] The curse will do its thing. I got this, Rainstorm. Don't worry. [Raine pulls away.]

Raine: Don't. [They grab Eda's arm sadly, rubbing the Bard Coven Sigil, then hold her hand between theirs.] Don't tell me not to worry.

Lilith: [Runs up and hugs Eda tearfully.] Edalyn, please be careful! If you need help, just, uh, flap your arms.

Hooty: Or scream real loud!

Lilith: Or-- or--

[Tears start welling up in Lilith's eyes. Eda touches Lilith's face reassuringly.]

Eda: Don't worry, Lily. With this spell declared, I promise I'll be back.

Lilith: That's not a spell. Doesn't even rhyme.

[Eda touches her and Lilith's foreheads together in a manner similar to the pain-sharing spell. Hooty rises up behind them with tears in his eyes as well, and Eda kisses the top of his head. She then activates her cloaking stone and starts heading toward the central platform, but hesitates.]

[As she looks back, a vision briefly appears on the screen: younger versions of Raine, Lilith, Darius, Alador, Odalia, Principal Bump, and Perry Porter. The other younger selves fade away until only Raine and Lilith are left. The vision then disappears to reveal current Raine and Lilith looking nervously at Eda. She smiles and winks at them both before proceeding forward to join the other Coven Heads, who are gathering in a circle around Belos.]

Belos: Oh! I forgot to mention, I decided to switch up the arrangement.

[Darius and Eda, disguised as Raine, are both shocked. Eberwolf gasps at this, but is shoved aside by Adrian's tail. Adrian takes his place next to a disguised Eda, looking very disheveled, much to her surprise.]

Adrian: [Sternly.] Don't say a word about my appearance. I will not be taking notes at this time.

[Terra pushes Darius away and stands beside Eda, still as Raine. She grins at her deviously.]

Terra: Hello, sprout!

Eda: [Gulps nervously.]

[Belos raises his arms, then draws a large glyph-like shape into the ground below himself and the Coven Heads. He raises his staff into the air and activates it.]

Belos: [Low voice.] Goodbye, Boiling Isles.

[He slams his staff into the ground and activates the glyph, sending large pillars of light into the air. All of the audience's Coven Sigils start glowing. He then turns into goo and disappears into the ground, reforming himself at the center of the Titan's Head where his portal is.]

The Collector: We did it! It's done, it's done! Now you can set me free and we can play new games!

Belos: I'm afraid that's impossible.

The Collector: [Confused.] Uh, excuse-a-what now? [Belos sets down The Collector's tablet.] B-But you said you'd use the Titan blood to help free me.

Belos: And I'm sorry, but I just realized I only have enough Titan's Blood to open the portal.

[Belos takes off his cape and ties his hair back so that he looks much more like Philip. He takes out the portal key and drains the last of its Titan's Blood into a device that powers the portal.]

The Collector: [Angrily.] But you said we were friends! W-We pinky-swore! [Begins screaming furiously.] You lied! Liar! Liar! Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar! Liar!--

[The Collector disappears when Belos places his cape over the mirror. Kikimora then walks through the door in her Abomatron with the orb containing Luz.]

Kikimora: Emperor, congratulations on this momentous day. [Her Abomatron kneels.] I come bearing a gift. [Belos slowly walks towards her.] You had been looking for the Golden Guard, and here he is! Perhaps this act is worthy of me returning to my old post. Or, if you're looking for a new right hand...

Belos: Have you as my right hand? I'd sooner cut off my whole arm.

Kikimora: But, uh, I just want to help.

Belos: You want to help? [He takes the cloak-covered mirror and drags Kikimora out with magic.] Go find a hole to wither away in. [Leaves a shocked Kikimora; then goes to the edge of the bridge and uncovers the mirror.] And you...

The Collector: [Furiously.] I gave you the draining spell. I taught you magic stronger than anybody's!

Belos: [Unfazed.] And that's why I won't release you. Can't have you giving that to anyone else. Goodbye.

[He throws the mirror and cloak off the bridge, and with it, the screaming Collector.]

The Collector: You're a liar, liar, pants on fire! [Screaming as their voice fades away.]

[The last word echoes as Belos walks away from the edge and back in the room where the portal and a captive Luz is held.]

Belos: Of course she'd mess up such a simple task. [He dispels the bubble, releasing Luz.] But I am glad to see you, my fellow human. [Luz does not move, surprising him.] What, no fight left? Or did you learn your lesson from last time?

[Luz finally turns around, confident.]

Luz: You wish.

[She inhales and uses an invisibility glyph and slaps it on her, and she disappears. Luz reappears behind Belos, which he sees.]

Luz: Spicy toss! [Releases a wave of flames towards Belos but he deflects it with his staff.]

Belos: Of course not. [Begins to attack her.]

[The scene transitions to the continuing eclipse. Hunter lifts up his glove, revealing the Emperor's Coven sigil underneath. He looks at Alador, with a worried expression on his face. The scene then pans to a reveal of the draining spell location, with the eclipse in the foreground. King looks on with a concerned expression, only to be surprised by a passing Emperor's Coven ship.]

Coven Scout: Your ship has been reported stolen. Land immediately!

Amity: [Growling angrily.] Mom...

[Gus casts an illusion spell, changing the ship's appearance to a flock of birds.]

Coven Scout: Don't be fooled! Take them down!

[The Abomatons keep shooting at the birds. Hunter suddenly wraps the Coven Scout around his own cloak, but gets knocked off his staff by an Abomaton. He fails to catch it and screams while falling as Flapjack flies after him. Suddenly, he is caught by Willow and blushes, then grabs his staff. The Abomatons keep shooting but get turned off by Amity. The illusion around the ship vanishes as the three return aboard.]

Alador: Why did I make those things so powerful? Stupid Alador, stupid!

[The ship suddenly rumbles, startling a concerned King. Sure enough, two more ships with more Abomatons are tailing them.]

Coven Scout: Fire! [The Abomatons do so.]

[The group's ship is destroyed and starts rocketing towards the ground. Everyone holds on to the rails as the scene slowly zooms towards King's eye. Scene the cuts to the Titan's head, where the draining spell is initiated. Everyone is rejoicing and cheering as the moon slowly comes in contact with the sun. Scene cuts to the Coven Heads, among them, a still-disguised Eda looking very nervous. Her arm then starts to bubble and everyone feels their magic weaken. Darius and Eberwolf notice this, but remain calm, satisfied that their plan is working perfectly.]

Healing Coven witch: What?

Healing Coven witch 2: It's getting weaker.

[Eda notices her curse delaying the draining spell, and attempts to hide it, however, Terra suddenly binds her shoulders.]

Terra: Looks like my suspicions were correct. Graye, if you'd please.

Adrian: [Draws a spell circle and points it at Eda.] Gladly. I love a good twist.

[The illusion dispels and Raine is revealed to be Eda in disguise.]

Eda: Hey!

[Upon seeing this, Eberwolf immediately summons his beast form and lunges at Terra, however it is blocked by Mason, the Construction Coven head, and his hammer. Eberwolf simply clings onto his hammer and summons flesh-eating insects which begin to crawl around him. Mason drops his hammer in shock and begins screaming and waving the bugs away, to no avail, as Eberwolf summons more of them that cover his head.]

Darius: Oh, for Titan's sake.

[Darius then transforms into a large abomination and begins fighting the other Coven Heads as well. Eberwolf is suddenly restrained by Osran, the Oracle Coven head, as Vitimir, the Potions Coven head, attacks Darius, but he slices off their hat. Eberwolf lets out a growl, forcing Darius to turn around, but Hettie, the Healing Coven head, throws a scalpel at Eberwolf and holds it down his throat, forcing Darius to turn back to his normal self and surrender as Vitimir puts him back in his place. Terra watches this with a disdained look.]

Terra: [Disappointed.] You too, Darius? Did you really think you'd get away with this?

[Mason recovers and returns to his place just as two Abomatons arrive, one of them carrying a weakened and restrained Raine. The other Abomaton comes over and begins to drag Eda away.]

Eda: No. No, no, no. No, no, no! Raine! [Gets dragged away.]

[Down the stairs, Lilith, Katya, Derwin and Hooty are also restrained, the latter trapped in a glowing orb similar to Luz's. Back with the Coven Heads, Raine gets carried and is prepared to be put in their place.]

Eda: Oh, you are making a big mistake!

Terra: My only mistake was letting you two live all those years ago.

[Raine gets dropped into their place.]

Eda: Raine!

Raine: Eda! [Their eyes suddenly glow.]

Terra: [Laughs evilly.] Hello, paradise! [Darius groans in pain.]

[The magic returns and everyone's sigils start to glow brightly.]

[Back inside the secret chamber, Luz nearly hits the ground but activates a safety hover glyph which slows her falling, and she runs away, avoiding Belos' attack. Luz hides behind a wall, panting.]

Belos: I didn't realize you're already combining glyphs! [Luz places an ice glyph on each pillar as she runs.] You do have a strange intuition with these. It took me years to figure that out. Almost like the Titan himself didn't want me to have that knowledge.

[Luz activates the glyphs but Belos, knowing the attack, destroys the ice shards.]

Belos: Though you're still decades away from beating me.

[He narrowly avoids a fire attack and restrains Luz with his hand, morphed into goo.]

Luz: [Screams; angered.] Eat dirt, Belos!

Belos: It's Philip. And despite our differences, I want to help you, Luz. I can send you home. I have just enough Titan Blood for one more trip. [Luz looks towards the door and back at him.] Please. I don't want to see another human life destroyed by this place.

Luz: You're such a hypocrite. You talk big about protecting humanity, but after everything you've done, you're barely human yourself.

[As she speaks, Belos' scar on his face returns.]

Belos: I do pity you. These monsters have warped your sense of reality. [Luz's expression remains angered.] Perhaps it'd be merciful to put you out of your misery. [Activates a spell to petrify her.]

[Luz's body slowly starts to turn to stone.]

Luz: Wait. Wait, wait, wait! You-- You can't! You-- [Looks around the room and spots a branding glove.] Y-You do realize you've been gone from the Human Realm for centuries. Times have changed. You wanna be known as the Emperor of the Witch Hunters, right?

Belos: Witch Hunter General.

Luz: Sure, sure. Uh, Witch Hunter General. But those aren't really a thing anymore. No one's gonna take you seriously if you start ranting about the Demon Realm. Not to mention a fashion sense like that...

[Belos glances at his clothes, surprised.]

Luz: [With a unimpressed look.] Yikes, my dude.

[Belos throws Luz away as she knocks over the table, and spotting the branding glove, immediately hides it behind her.]

Belos: So what? You're offering to be my modern-day guide?

Luz: I'm not offering anything. But I do wanna make a deal. [Belos looks intrigued.] I can't beat you. I know that. So... I will return to the Human Realm, and I will be your guide. If you spare my friends.

[Belos scoffs at this. Luz is almost completely petrified.]

Luz: Come on. You'll need living proof that this realm exists. You'd do anything to save humanity, well, [Tears start welling up in her eyes.] I'd do anything to save the people I love. Please... Philip!

[Belos looks satisfied and reverses the petrification, surprising Luz.]

Belos: Fine.

Luz: [Holds out her hand.] Then shake on it. Human style.

[Belos looks skeptical, but Luz holds out both her arms and shakes them, implying that she isn't hiding anything. Belos takes her hand and shakes it when suddenly, Luz's other hand immediately grabs his hand, and the back of his hand starts burning. He yells in pain and recoils, his arm now branded with the Emperor's Coven sigil. Luz exhales deeply and the branding glove reappears on her hand, revealing everything she said to be a trick, angering Belos.]

[Outside, the eclipse finally happens. At the Coven Heads, Eda fearfully watches the eclipse. Terra's look of victory diminishes when she notices her sigil is burning.]

Terra: Huh?

[The other Coven Heads also experience the same effect. Glowing veins start appearing on their bodies.]

Darius: No. We're too late.

[Once Eberwolf is released from the trap, he clutches his arm in pain.]

Terra: [Terrified.] What... is.. happening? Raine, Belos is giving us paradise, right? [Raine shakes their head in response.]

[Terra whimpers as she and the other Coven Heads start to collapse to the ground, affected by the draining spell. The other witches and Coven Scouts, upon seeing this, start to scream and attempt to escape and run away but are trapped inside by the Abomatons. Back inside the Titan's head, Belos also collapses as a result of the draining spell.]

Luz: You'll never make it out of here, unless you stop the draining spell right now! [Belos does not respond.] I. Said. Stop it!

[Instead, Belos transforms into his monster form and a horrified Luz backs up. Having fully transformed, Belos looks back at Luz.]

[Cut to King's POV. He slowly wakes up and groans as he sees Alador fighting off the Abomatons as Amity, Willow, Gus and Hunter recover.]

Gus: [Muffled.] Oh, my head.

Hunter: [Muffled.] Willow, are you okay? Come on, I'll help you up.

[Alador continues fighting off the Abomatons as Amity approaches him.]

Amity: [Muffled.] Dad. Dad! Dad, are you--

Alador: [Muffled.] Take this. [Hands her the controller.]

Amity: [Muffled.] Dad, no! We're not gonna leave you!

[Alador simply kisses her forehead and continues fighting the Abomatons as Willow and Hunter drag her away.]

Willow: [Muffled.] Amity, come on, we can't stay!

Hunter: [Muffled.] We have to go!

[The gang collect their palismen and start running away.]

Gus: [Approaches King.] King, King, are you okay?

[King faints again. When he opens his eyes, he sees all the weakened Coven Heads lying on the ground. Hunter approaches Darius as Willow and Amity run past them.]

Hunter: [Muffled.] Darius? Darius? Darius, wake up! [Echoing.]

[Willow and Amity reach Eda and find her unconscious but held by the Abomaton. Amity turns it off just as Eda collapses into Willow's arms.]

Willow: [Inaudible.] Eda! I've got her!

[King blinks and the scene zooms to her, Amity and a still-unconscious Eda.]

Willow: [Inaudible.] She's not waking up.

Amity: [Muffled.] We have to get to the head. Luz could be in trouble. [The last word echoes as King closes his eyes again.]

[King opens his eyes for the third time.]

King: [Rubbing his skull; part of it is now cracked.] Eh... eh?

[When King regains consciousness, he finds the gang riding on their staffs and Gus carrying him as they all head towards Luz.]

[Back inside the secret quarters, Belos, still in his monster form, continues to chase Luz around, who keeps evading him.]

Luz: Okay. I-I know you're mad, but we can still fix things... just, stop the spell!

[Belos lunges at her but she avoids him just in time, however he hits and nearly damages the portal door by accident.]

Luz: The door... watch the door! [Yelps as she escapes another of Belos' attack.]

[She inhales as she takes an invisibility glyph and slaps it on herself, and she disappears. Belos begins to search for Luz around the room. She then appears at the door leading outside the room.]

Luz: Over here!

[Luz opens the door and runs through, Belos following her. She stops and turns around. Belos rises behind her.]

Belos: We don't belong here!

Luz: I'm not like you!

[Belos prepares to attack Luz but is stopped by vines. Belos falls, revealing King, Willow, Gus, Amity and Hunter.]

Willow: We're here to help!

Amity: Did you really think we wouldn't follow you?

Gus: Yeah girl, get with it.

Luz: You guys are literally the coolest!

[Belos gets up a little.]

Luz: We have to get him to stop the draining spell, but he's all...berserk mad!

[Willow summons more vines to pull Belos back. The bridge they're on starts to break. Belos breaks free of the vines and causes rubble to start falling.]

Amity: [Summons an abomination shield and covers Luz and herself.] Luz!

[Gus takes King to a safe spot and puts him down.]

Gus: It's about to get real scary. You stay here.

King: But I can help!

[Belos fully breaks free of the vines and roars. Amity uses an abomination hand to grab him, and that gets frozen by one of Luz's glyphs. Hunter teleports to Willow and breaks the rubble about to fall on her.]

Willow: Gus!

Gus: On my way!

[King tries to follow, but a tremor causes him to fall backwards and down a staircase. He stands up and watches the battle from below.]

Kikimora: It's pointless. [King turns to face her; she's lying in her Abomatron, forlorn.] Belos can't stop the spell any more than they can. Only The Collector has that power.

King: Who... is The Collector? [He walks towards Kikimora.]

Kikimora: Neither witch nor demon, a child from the stars. Belos only talked to him when he thought no one was around, but I was always listening. Belos was afraid of him.

King: An opportunity. Take me to him!

Kikimora: If that means kicking the Emperor's butt, [Her Abomatron stands up slowly.] gladly. [She gestures to a staircase leading downwards.]

[Back on the bridge, Amity makes a rope out of abomination goo and uses it to restrain Belos as Gus prepares to cast a spell on him.]

Gus: Alright, Belos, time to calm down a little.

[Gus activates the spell, and immediately, Belos breaks free of the rope as he writhes around in pain. He accidentally smashes a pillar which almost falls, but Willow manages to hold it with vines as Amity regroups with the others. Belos flashes back to some of his memories and screeches loudly. Gus, having difficulty controlling the spell, is about to get attacked by Belos when Hunter speeds over and pushes him out of the way, just as he snaps out of the spell with a look of revelation and shock on his face. Belos, also released from the spell, approaches Hunter and transforms his face to its human visage.]

Belos: Hunter, why are you hurting me? I only wanted to help you!

Hunter: You're... You're lying! [Belos immediately spots Flapjack.]

Belos: Caleb?! [His face deforms again before he screeches loudly.]

[Somewhere, deep down the Titan's bones, King and Kikimora have arrived to a place filled with skeletons and Golden Guard masks.]

King: What is this place?

Kikimora: [Turns around.] Where the failures end up.

[King steps forward and spots the crescent-shaped mirror, with Belos' former robe hanging with it. After hesitating for a while, King touches the mirror, and out comes The Collector. However, his demeanor has changed as a result of Belos' betrayal against them.]

The Collector: Leave me alone. I don't associate with fibbers. [Blows raspberry.]

[Noticing something, The Collector opens their eyes and spots King's shadow, but can't see King himself.]

The Collector: Wait. I know someone's there, I can feel it. But why can't I see you?

[King is also confused, then it is revealed he is protected from being seen by The Collector as a result of the symbol engraved onto his collar. He takes it off and reveals himself. The Collector gasps in shock.]

The Collector: [Approaches King.] You look like that bully who put me in here. No way, are you his little Titan baby? I've always wanted to play with you! But your dumb pops hid you. Hey, do you like hide and seek? I'll hide first! [Starts to hide.]

King: Wait, wait! Mr. Collector, please, we need you to stop this draining spell.

The Collector: Mister? [Exasperated sigh.] You are soooo boring.

[King thinks for a while.]

King: Well, you know what's better than hide and seek? A game called "The" uh- "The Owl House"!

The Collector: [Curiously.] Ooh, how do you play?

King: Oh, it's so fun, like, the most fun! And I can show you if you want. We're gonna need a lot of players, like, a whole island's worth of players but, uh... [Sighs.] aw, shucks.

The Collector: What's wrong?

King: Well, gee, everyone's gonna perish from this ding-dang draining spell. Guess we can't play that awesome game after all. Man, it was fun though.

[He begins to walk away but The Collector stops him.]

The Collector: Wait, if you're a Titan, you can let me out. I can stop the spell! And we could play together!

King: Golly, you'd do that?

The Collector: [Suspicious.] Wait, you're not tricking me into doing your chores like Philip, are you?

King: I would never! Pinky swear.

[He offers his pinky finger out to him, and The Collector laughs deviously at this. Suddenly, from above, the ground starts rumbling.]

King: I'll even let you out right now. W-What do I need to do? D-Do-Do you need my... blood?

The Collector: No, silly! [They go towards the mirror and stick out their pinky finger.] Just... follow my lead.

[Back on the bridge, Luz runs forward to catch a falling Amity.]

Luz: Amity! [They both grunt as Belos lunges at them.]

[Downstairs, The Collector places their pinky hand in the mirror. King links it and when he pulls it out, a hand starts coming out of the mirror, linked to his pinky finger. The mirror slowly breaks. Cut to a view of Eda's gray eye. She gasps and wakes up. Sitting up, her body starts to wither and decay as a result of her curse, and she yells in pain. Her right hand, still branded with the Bard Coven sigil, is suddenly held by Raine, who has managed to crawl over to her.]

Eda: Raine?

Raine: [Weakly.] I promised a special kid... I'd protect you.

[Raine then detaches Eda's arm off and lets it disintegrate. Eda suddenly stops decaying, however, Raine gets weaker and they eventually pass out.]

Eda: Raine!

[As Eda holds Raine in tears, a flash of thunder suddenly overlaps the scene and transitions into the broken mirror as it drops to the ground. A hooded entity appears as they turn around, a flash of bright light emitting from them. Kikimora shields her eyes as the screen fades to white and fades to Luz, Amity, Willow, Hunter (who has collapsed while holding his arm in pain) and Gus, all exhausted from fighting Belos. He prepares to attack them, and the group shields themselves. The attack is suddenly halted by something unseen. Luz opens her eyes to see who is stopping the attack, and it's shown to be the hand of The Collector, now in their true form.]

The Collector: Whatcha playin'?

[Luz and Amity are surprised. Belos, hiding his horror, slowly backs up.]

Belos: Collector! [The Collector glares at him.] You're free, just as promised...

The Collector: As promised? I remember someone throwing me off a bridge. I'm not angry though. Say, you wanna play tag?

[They twirl their finger around and Belos is immediately whisked towards them.]

The Collector: I'm it.

[They tap his nose and Belos immediately gets launched above the door, seemingly killed. Drips of his goo splatter on the floor. The group is equally shocked and horrified.]

The Collector: [Laughs.] Too slow! [Looks back at the others.] You guys look slow too. [Raises their finger as they start walking towards them.] Do you need a head start?

[Before The Collector can reach the group, however, King blocks the path.]

King: Whoa, whoa, Collector! Buddy, pal!

The Collector: [Happily.] King!

King: Remember what we talked about? You gotta help all my friends outside, or, uh, we won't get to play "Owl House". [Looks back at the group.]

Luz: Uh... Owl House? Uh, gosh! [Chuckles nervously.] I love that game!

Amity: The memories last a lifetime!

Willow: I play it everyday!

Gus: I play it every hour!

Hunter: [Squeals nervously.]

King: I'll explain the rules later, but remember, we need lots of players.

[The Collector walks forward and everyone clears the way. They look outside and spot the eclipse draining the magic out of everyone outside. They then enlarge their eyes to spot everyone unconscious as a result, including the Coven Heads. After thinking for a while, he decides to stop the spell.]

The Collector: Hmm. Okay! [Moves the moon beside the sun with a touch of their finger.] Boop.

[The spell immediately stops as the group watches. Willow, Gus and Hunter notice the latter's veins have disappeared. Back outside, everyone starts to groan and wake up.]

The Collector: Hmm. [The group immediately shoots them suspecting looks and they chuckle.] If we're gonna play Owl House, [Starts floating in the air.] we're gonna need an Owl House!

[They slap their hands together, and every part of the island starts to disassemble to prepare for the game as the teens and King watch in shock. Luz shields King from the impact.]

The Collector: We're gonna have a blast, everyone!

[As the platform in front of her hovers away and she steps back, Willow looks back and immediately spots the portal door.]

Willow: [To the others.] I think there's a way out!

[The others start to follow her, but Luz stops at the last minute and looks back. Amity notices this.]

Amity: Luz, come on!

Luz: Everyone-- Eda, I-I can't just leave them!

Amity: Luz, [Tears start welling in her eyes.] please!

[Eventually, Luz relents and everyone runs towards the portal. When Willow, Hunter and Gus reach the remnants of Belos, Hunter hesitates to step over it.]

Gus: Hunter!

[Hunter eventually overcomes it and runs over the goo, however, unbeknownst to him and everyone else, a small drop of Belos' goo drips onto him. As the teens reach the flickering portal, Luz sees that it's about to collapse. After waiting for a while, the light returns and Hunter opens the door. At first, it shows the In Between Realm then cuts to the rain in the Human Realm.]

Gus: It's human rain. It's okay. [He, Willow and Hunter run inside.]

Amity: [Runs forward but looks back.] Luz?

[Luz is shown activating plant glyphs and pulling them, keeping the portal from falling apart, although has great difficulty holding them together.]

Amity: Luz, what are you doing? [The door suddenly disconnects from the Human Realm but eventually returns as the others attempt to go back.]

Luz: I-I have to get Eda. We'll find a way back to you!

[The Collector, however, spots what is happening and turns to look.]

Luz: Go! Go, go, go! I-I can't hold the portal much longer! [King begins to get dragged away from her and she attempts to grab onto him.] King!

The Collector: [Getting angry.] King! You promised you'd play with me! You [Drags King by their pinky finger.] pinky-swore!

[Luz and King struggle to hold on to each other as the latter starts to get pulled away.]

Amity: [Runs towards them.] Luz!

Luz: [To King.] We gotta stick together. We gotta stick together!

King: [Contemplates for awhile.] I'm sorry, not this time. But I can keep you safe.

Luz: [Tears start to drip down her face.] No!

King: Luz, I'm so happy I had you as a big sister.

[He inhales deeply and uses his sonic shout, losing his grip to Luz and causing her, Amity, Willow, Gus and Hunter to get knocked into the portal and Human Realm altogether.]

Luz: No! [Runs back towards the door.] King!

[She attempts to reach the portal, but the door closes on her just as she reaches it. She opens it, hoping the portal would activate again, only to find the empty room of the house in front of her. She tries it two more times unsuccessfully, as the others look on in shock. Luz turns around, just as Gus begins to break down crying. Meanwhile, inside the Noceda residence, Camila is in the kitchen cooking soup for a hungry Vee while reading a news article about Anne Boonchuy. Both then suddenly hear a knock on the door. Camila opens it, and gasps in shock to find the five teens looking disheveled out in the rain, as Luz looks up at her.]

Luz: Hey, Mom. I'm back. [Starts tearing up.]

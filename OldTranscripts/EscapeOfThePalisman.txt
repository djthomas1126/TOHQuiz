Luz: [Visibly nervous.] What if he gets hurt? What if the kids are mean to him? [Gasps.] My parental instincts are freaking out, man.

Eda: He's fine. Look at him.

[Cut to King trying to climb the slide.]

Luz: It does look like he's having fun.

[King grunts.]

Luz: Aw. I wonder what cute little game he's playing.

King: Stand back, cretins. [Grunting as he reaches the top.] Yes! Yes! This is a throne worthy of a tyrant. Bow to me you snotty underlings. Bow!

Kids: [Share a look.] Okay.

[One does a handstand while the other does a backbend.]

King: Yes, appease your master.

Usurper: This isn't for standing, it's for sliding. You try. [Shoves him.]

King: Whoa, whoa! [Screams, grunts.] Eda! [Runs to his friends, clings to Luz's leg.] That monster took my throne.

Eda: You mean the baby?

King: No, the usurper. I want you to go over there and blow him up. Kaboom!

Usurper: [Riding a spring rider.] Kaboom!

Eda: [Unscrews Owlbert from her staff.] Yeah, I'm not using Owlbert to blow up a five-year-old.

[Owlbert hoots.]

Eda: He's got better things to do. Like this... [Pets him.]

[Owlbert warbles.]

Luz: Aw, what a sweetie. How did you get him?

Eda: Get? I made Owlbert from the branch of an ancient tree.

Owlbert: [Hops onto Eda's hand, hoots.]

Eda: Oh, he's my palisman and we're bonded for life. [Owlbert hops to her shoulder, nuzzling her cheek.] I'd annihilate anyone who'd hurt him.

King: Fine. Don't help. Revenge will taste all the sweeter if they fall by my hand alone. [Laughs.]

Usurper: [Shoves King over.] Tag, you're it! [Laughs and runs off.]

Eda: Oh, man. Here we go. King's squeak of rage.

King: [Stands.] Nyeh... nyeh... [Squeals while wriggling and punching on the air, pauses, then continues squealing as he charges after his rival.]

Eda: [Laughs.] He is like a little teakettle. [Snorts.]

[Owlbert scratches at his face.]

Luz: Hey, what's that? [Points to Owlbert's foot, which seems to have a hole.]

Eda: That's his interlock. So he only fits on to my staff. Every palisman has one.

[As she speaks, everything but her, her staff, and the bench disappears.]

Eda: [Gasps.] Luz?

[She stands and looks around the void. Both her staff and the bench disappear.]

Eda: Hello?

Luz: [Echoing.] Eda?

Eda: Luz!

[The real world returns as Luz and Owlbert look over Eda.]

Luz: Eda! Eda! Wake up!

[Eda's eyes open. She is now laying down on the bench.]

Luz: Are you all right? [Helps Eda up.]

Eda: [Shudders.] What? Oh, no. The curse. Hey, we have to get home. Now! [Picks up her staff and leaves.]

Luz: King we have to go!

King: [Atop the jungle gym, facing Usurper.] Five more minutes, please!

Luz: King!

King: Ah, man. This isn't over.

Usurper: Okay, let's play again real soon. [Hugs King.]

King: No, no. Keep those sticky hands away! Oh, no! He's touching me! [Screams.]

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to the Owl House, where Eda tosses her staff to the couch. She yawns and flops face first onto the couch.]

Luz: I'll go get your elixir.

Eda: [Muffled.] Don't worry about it. I'll get it myself in a bit.

Luz: Do you need me to stay home and take care of you? [Gasps.] I could put King in a little doctor's outfit.

[Everyone looks at King, who looks up from a stack of paper.]

King: Meh?

Eda: No one wants to see that.

Luz: I do.

Eda: Look, I know how to take care of myself. I've had this curse longer than you've been alive.

Luz: So, how'd you get it?

Eda: [Grunts.] I don't know.

Luz: You don't know?

Eda: Somebody gave it to me. I don't know who and I don't care because I'm fine, all right? Anyway, don't you have plans with Tweedledum and Twerpledee?

Luz: Well, Willow, Gus, and I are going to the grudgby game between Hexside and Glandus High.

Eda: [Screws Owlbert back onto the staff.] Since when are you into sports?

Luz: Since I found a little something called "Hexside Pride." [Grunts.] To think that Glandus, whoever they are, would dare face us. But if you need me to stay...

Eda: Gross. Sympathy. Go! Go have fun at sport.

Luz: Hooray! Hooray for sport! Hugs and kisses, King. [Kisses his skull.] Mwah! [Sing-songy.] Don't spend all night plotting revenge.

King: [Sing-songy.] That drooly-faced heathen will know my wrath.

[Cut to Hexside, where students are lined up to get on a dragon bus. Luz is running toward it but not paying attention.]

Luz: Hexside's gonna wreck your side. [Stops walking.] Huh, no. [Keeps walking.] Hexside is the best side in the west side. [Yelps.]

[The dragon bus roars and bites at Luz.]

Luz: [Shudders.] Ah! Friends.

Willow and Luz: Whoo-hoo!

Gus: Game day roar!

Luz: Happy game day, fellow, uh... Are we Hexidians? Hexies? [Gasps.] Hexoleos?

Willow: Actually, most people call us... winners.

Gus: Grudgby games are the best. The players go through these action-packed trials. And the audience gets to wave flags. Look, I practiced.

[He pulls out two flags, turns in a circle as he waves them and hums.]

Luz: [Looks at her hoodie.] Is it weird that I'm not wearing anything Hexside?

Willow: Um, it's weirder that you're wearing Glandus colors. [Points to a sign behind Luz. Sure enough, her hoodie's colors are the same as Glandus High's.]

Giant Boy: Get ready to be creamed, Glandus nerd.

Luz: Hey! I'm a Hexside nerd. Gotta change out of this shirt. Where can I get a Hexside one?

Gus: I know. There's a lost and found box in the cafeteria.

Luz: Ah! The lost and found. Where mouthguards go to retire.

[Cut to the lost and found, a giant chest. Luz opens it and pulls out a hat.]

Luz: Yes!

[Cut to the front doors of Hexside, which Luz exits in full Hexside apparel waving pom-poms.]

Luz: Goooo, Hexside! [Does a split and winces as a crack is heard.] Well, I never did that before. Uh, where is everyone?

[The dragon bus is flying away.]

Giant Boy: Hexside rules!

Luz: Oh, no! Come back! Why didn't you guys board the bus?

Willow: We weren't going to leave you behind.

Gus: I was.

Willow: Gus! [Elbows him.]

Luz: Can we walk to Glandus?

Gus: We'd never make it in time. Glandus is... [Rolls his flags, points with them.] all the way out in the middle of the island.

Luz: [Scoffs.] Typical Glandus.

Willow: And my parents are working, otherwise I'd see if they could give us a ride on their staff.

Luz: A staff... because staffs fly. Of course. I can get us a staff.

Gus: You can?

Luz: Yes, come on.

[Luz grabs Willow's hand and runs. Gus leaps after them. Cut to the doors of Eda's bedroom.]

King: Eda! Great news. I thought of the perfect way to get revenge on that usurper. [Holds out a piece of paper reading "FIRE?".] Now, don't be put off by the complicated premise. I'll break it down for you in small pieces. Huh?

[Eda, almost completely in her Owl Beast form, is sitting in her nest. She growls and advances on King.]

King: [Screams, falls down.] Owl Beast! [Screams.] Stay back!

[Eda stops and backs up.]

King: Did you just listen to me? [Stands up.] Uh, come here. Sit.

[Eda takes a step forward, then snorts.]

King: Oh, this is an interesting development.

[Eda warbles.]

King: Eda's only partially transformed which means she's totally suggestible. [Chuckles.] Yes. Yes! I think this will do nicely. Forget fire. I've got a greater force to unleash. You! You're going to help me regain my throne. I mean, if that's okay with you. Right?

[Eda growls.]

King: I'll take that weird grumble as a yes. I'm just gonna grab a little bottle of elixir in case you go rogue on me.

[He grabs a full bottle of elixir and a messenger bag. Several empty bottles fall out of the bag as he drags it.]

King: Now, to destiny's battlefield: the playground!

Luz: [Offscreen.] King, are you home?

[Eda growls.]

King: What? [To Eda.] Sit. Stay.

Luz: Is Eda up?

King: [Closes doors.] Who? Oh. [Chuckles.] That Eda. No, no. She is out like a light.

[Eda growls.]

King: [Chuckles.] Oh, man. Can she snore.

Luz: Oh, no. I wanted to ask if I could borrow her staff but I know she needs her rest.

King: [Grabs Eda's staff and gives it to Luz.] Oh, I'm sure it's fine. It's fine. Just take it.

Luz: I can't. Not without Eda's permission.

[Eda screams.]

King: Well, there's your permission. Off you go.

Luz: I really owe Gus and Willow one. And it's just for the afternoon. I'm sure Eda wouldn't mind.

King: Not our generous, kindhearted Eda. Big heart on her.

[They stare at each other for a second.]

Luz: [Starts to leave.] I'll be back soon.

King: Close call.

Luz: [Stops leaving.] What?

King: Nothing.

Luz: Oh, okay. [Leaves for real.]

King: Close call. [Opens the doors.] And now revenge. Right, Owl Eda?

[Eda munches a chair.]

King: [Chuckles.] I'm feeling confident about this plan.

[Cut to the front of the Owl House as Luz opens the door.]

Luz: To Glandus High.

[She gestures with the staff, hitting Owlbert against the house. Owlbert hoots.]

Luz: Oh! Sorry, Owlbert. It's okay. We're just on our way to help some friends.

Willow and Gus: Ooh!

Luz: Who's ready to board Air Luz?

[They all board the staff.]

Willow: Feel that power-to-weight ratio.

Gus: [To his flags.] Boys, prepare to fly.

Luz: Next stop, Glandus High. Let's go.

[The staff rises in the air.]

Luz: Step on it, Owlbert.

[She slaps the staff. Owlbert squawks, rushes forward.]

All: Whoa! Whoa!

[The staff does a loop-de-loop, then runs into several trees. The trio grunts and screams. They hit a tree head on. Willow and Gus fall directly into a bush. Luz gets caught on a branch, then falls out of her Hexside sweater. She grunts. Owlbert falls directly on top of his head. He looks at his now cracked head and hoots.]

Luz: [Groans, stands.] Is everyone okay? Huh?

[Owlbert hoots, twists himself off the staff, then flies off.]

Luz: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no! Owlbert, come back!

[Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus running through the forest.]

Luz: Owlbert!

[Owlbert hoots as he flies into a foreboding cave. The trio stop running, panting.]

Gus: Man, humans can run. Must be their dorsal fins.

Luz: He went through those trees. Come on. [Starts running.]

Willow: [Stops Luz.] We have to be careful. It's really easy to get lost in this part of the forest.

Luz: This is Eda's palisman, Willow. She'll kill me if we don't get it back. Let's go.

[Cut to the inside of the cave. Bats screech as they enter. Bones crunch under their feet.]

Willow: Wow. I keep stepping on a lot of crunchy twigs.

Luz: Those are bones, Willow.

Willow: [Looks up.] Not if I never look down.

[A shadow passes them. They yelp, and step closer together.]

Luz: This isn't any kind of forest I'm used to. [Pokes a spiderweb with the staff.]

Willow: That's because this isn't a forest.

[The Bat Queen's kids chirp as they approach the teens.]

Willow: It's a nest.

Luz: Hey, I remember you. You're Bat Queen's babies.

[The bat babies screech.]

Gus: Wait. The Bat Queen? [Backs away.]

Willow: [Also backs away.] I think I'd rather take my chances with Eda.

Luz: [Walks towards the bats.] Uh, we're looking for a little owl and... There he is.

[Owlbert is standing a bit behind the bat babies. He warbles, backs into the shadows.]

Luz: Owlbert, thank goodness you're okay. Come here, buddy. Time to go home.

[The Bat Queen steps in front of Owlbert and into the light. They all gasp.]

Bat Queen: [Hisses.] Hello, small human.

[Cut to the Slayground. Kids are chattering and laughing. One kid makes a sandcastle in the sandbox. Loud footsteps knock it down. Eda growls.]

King: Ahem!

[Eda growls. With King on her back, she is sitting on the roof of a house.]

King: Listen carefully. You all have two choices. Grovel or—

[Eda screeches. The children scream.]

Braxas: Ah! A monster.

[The kids all flee.]

King: Good enough. Whoa!

[Eda jumps off the roof. The kids scream.]

King: Run! Despair!

[Usurper whimpers.]

King: Your time has ended. Mine begins.

[Usurper, crying, goes down the slide.]

King: Not so tough now, you spongy hatchlings. I will eat you.

[Eda growls.]

King: [Climbs the slide.] All who stood in my way are gone. I declare myself despotic ruler of this land. Nothing can stop the almighty—

[Crunch.]

King: Huh? Hmm?

[Eda is eating the slide.]

King: Hey. Whoa, whoa! No eating the throne.

[Eda looks longingly at the slide.]

King: Noooo!

[Eda munches.]

King: [Whiny.] Stop that!

[Cut back to the Bat Queen's nest. The Bat Queen exhales.]

Willow: It's the...

Luz: Bat Queen. I know. We kinda babysat her kids once. Don't worry. I got this. [To Bat Queen.] Hiya, BQ. My, your hair is looking greasy. And your kids [Chuckles.] they're as hideous as ever.

Gus: You know, that coulda gone worse.

[The Bat Queen growls.]

Luz: [Chuckles.] So... Owlbert ran away and I need to get him back. I'm just gonna grab him and we'll be on our way.

[Bat Queen puts a claw on Luz's chest.]

Luz: Ah!

Bat Queen: To be careless with a staff, it's very serious. I protect him.

Luz: And thank you for that, uh, but he belongs to Eda, the Owl Lady. [Removes Bat Queen's claw.] And you owe her a favor, remember?

Bat Queen: Owl Lady is careless. Her staff left her sight. Taken by human who steals, hurts, frightens...

Luz: Huh?

Bat Queen: He told me all.

[Bat Queen's eyes glow yellow. Owlbert's glow the same color.]

Luz: Owlbert, I never meant to hurt you. [Kneels down.] Please trust me.

[Owlbert hoots, then flies onto Bat Queen's head. Both their eyes glow again. Luz stands.]

Bat Queen: Trust must be earned... [Flies to a perch.] ...through trials!

[Fire bursts from the ground with the final word.]

Gus: [Happily, waving flags.] Trials?

Willow: Luz, the Bat Queen is well-known for her impossible trials. I've never heard of anyone winning against her.

Luz: But I have to get Owlbert back. I accept your challenge.

Willow: And we'll be right there with you.

Gus: Let the flags raise you up.

[Bat Queen closes her claw. Webs encase Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Hey!

Willow: What?

Bat Queen: No helpsies. Now, let the trials begin. Milk the spider demon.

[A spider with udders approaches Luz, holding a bucket. The spider demons growls. Luz grunts, and looks at at Owlbert. He hoots, and tilts his head.]

Luz: All right. Come here, pal. Let's do this.

[The spider demon runs, squealing.]

Luz: If you run, you'll just make this harder for yourself.

[Cut to one of the flames extinguishing.]

Bat Queen: Remove bees nest.

[Luz climbs a tree, empty staff in hand. A giant buzzing bees nest is sitting in one of the branches. She raises the staff to smack the nest, but it turns into the head of a giant bee that screeches at her. She yelps, and falls out of the tree. Cut to her running past Willow and Gus, screaming, the bee screeching after her.]

Gus: Come on. Almost got it. [Frees himself from the webs.] I am free! Bat Queen, you will rue the day you tried to trap—

[She traps him again, this time suspended from the ceiling.]

Gus: Aaah.

[A second flame goes out.]

Bat Queen: Give babies a bath!

[Cut to Luz scrubbing one baby bat, sitting on another, a third biting her shoulder. They're all covered in suds. Luz grunts. The bat babies screech.]

Willow: Go, Luz.

Gus: Luz, we're here if you need us.

Willow: Yeah. Cut us free. We can get Eda.

Luz: No, I was selfish, [The bat babies' screeching continues.] and I hurt Owlbert. I need to do this alone so he knows I care about him. [Dumps barrel of water over the baby bats.]

[The bat babies are screeching, then turn around to show their hair neat and faces shiny.]

Luz: Aw!

[Bat babies shake their heads; return to normal and screech. Luz screams. Cut to the Slayground, where Eda is eating a swing.]

King: No, no! Bad Eda! You are my beast and I control you. [Punches her wing.] Hey!

[Eda growls.]

King: [Yelping.] What was I thinking? I'm such a fool. I'm such a... [Grabs the bottle bag.]

[Eda's growling continues.]

King: ...genius!

[Eda snarls. King grunts, and throws the bottle in her mouth. She screeches, spits out cork.]

King: Great. Now, change back to Eda.

[Eda growls.]

King: Anytime now. Just magically transform.

[Eda snarls.]

King: Ah, nuts.

[Eda shreds King's cardboard box armor seconds after he ducks out of it. He runs down the rope net.]

King: [Grunting.] Whoa!

[Eda growls. A siren wails. Cut to a van reading "ANIMAL CONTROL". The demon hunters step out of it, now wearing reflective vests. Demon Hunter #1 steps off the van.]

Demon Hunter #2: Uh, this is so embarrassing.

Demon Hunter #1: Hey, hey. This job is all we have right now. So, I wanna see happy faces. Okay?

[Demon Hunter #2 gives a thumbs up and sarcastic smile.]

Demon Hunter #1: Let's roll out.

[Demon Hunter #2 sticks out their tongue.]

King: Ah! Animal control.

Demon Hunter #1: Matches the description the parents called in. Bag it.

King: Oh, no! No, no, no!

[Eda stalks toward them, growling. The demon hunters combine spells to create a large green net. Eda tries to jump out of it. She is screeching. The net shrinks to fit her. Demon Hunter #1 shocks her. King yelps. Eda falls to the ground. Demon Hunter #1 lifts her away.]

King: Eda!

[Eda is put into the animal control van. The doors close behind her. King tries to free himself from the rope net.]

King: [Grunting.] Whoa! Awesome. Fantastic.

[Cut back to Bat Queen's nest. The third flame goes out. Gus frees himself from the web again, landing in a handstand.]

Gus: Yes, I am free again. I—

[Webs encase him yet again. He screams, muffled, and waves his legs.]

Luz: Okay, Bat Queen. That's the last one. I've done all your chores. And I've proved my dedication to Owlbert. I'm so sorry for the pain I caused you, Owlbert. I promise to be more careful. Will you come back home with me?

[Owlbert nods and hoots. He flies off of Bat Queen's perch to the ground. Bat Queen raises her claw, and webs encase Owlbert. He squawks.]

Bat Queen: No! More trials. Last trial. You must face... me.

[She expands her wings, a jet of flames going up behind her.]

Luz: What?

[The Bat Queen roars, flies forward. Luz, yelping, runs.]

Bat Queen: You will never get him back!

[Luz grunts.]

Willow: Luz, get us out. We can help.

[Luz frees Willow. Willow frees Gus.]

Willow: Look out!

[The bat babies screech.]

Gus: I'll hold'em off with my flags.

[The bat babies, screeching, attack Willow and Gus.]

Gus: No! That was a bad plan.

[Cut to Luz sneaking off. Luz yelps, and the Bat Queen roars. She chases Luz through the forest. Owlbert squawks as he frees a wing from the web. Cut to Luz running.]

Luz: I won't let you imprison Owlbert.

[The Bat Queen roars. Luz grunts and trips. The Bat Queen roars again, Luz gasps and grunts. The Bat Queen flies down to attack Luz. She stops her claws with the staff. She's roaring.]

Luz: [Gasps.] Is that an interlock? [Kicks the staff and Bat Queen away.] Bat Queen, you used to be on a staff, didn't you? You were a Palisman.

[The Bat Queen gasps. Cut to the Slayground, where King is still stuck in the net.]

King: Nyeh! [Frees himself.] Oof.

Usurper: Your pride has destroyed you. The throne belongs to me now.

King: Over my dead body.

[Eda screeches.]

King: Eda!

Usurper: Yes, leave and forfeit your reign.

King: Well, then, forfeit I shall. [Runs.] I'm coming for you, Eda. [Panting.] Huh?

[Eda screeches. The animal control van is stuck at a snail road crossing. A giant snail with windows in its shell is slowly making its way across. Eda continues screeching. King runs to the animal control van. He hefts himself into the back through a window. Eda snorts.]

King: You in there, Eda?

[Eda snarls.]

King: Eda, I'm sorry. I used you for your strength 'cause I felt weak. I'm your friend. If only there were some way to remind you who I am.

[Eda growls and snarls.]

King: Wait a sec. Eda loves my rage squeal. Like this... [Grunting, squealing.]

Eda: [Snorts, laughs. Snarls.] So tiny. So angry. [Laughing. She growls, grunts, and turns back to normal. She groans.]

King: Eda, you're back! [Hugs her.]

Eda: What happened?

King: Okay, so I went to your room and you were the beast. And then... And then I woke up here one second before you did.

Eda: Uh-huh. I'll deal with you later. But for now, you wanna bounce?

King: Yes, please.

[Eda explodes the back of the van.]

Demon Hunter #1: Aah! Where did it go? [To Eda.] Hey, lady. H-Have you seen a monster that kinda looks like you? Lady!

[Eda walks off with King under her arm. Cut to the forest.]

Luz: You were once a Palisman, weren't you?

[Bat Queen looks at her claw with the interlock on it. She turns away from Luz.]

Bat Queen: Yes, I was once part of a grand staff. A staff made for a giant. But I was broken, discarded.

Luz: So, that's why you're so protective of Owlbert.

Bat Queen: I protect... all!

[Her eyes glow again. Behind her, dozens of other eyes begin glowing. Luz gasps. Countless broken and scarred palismen of every type are in the trees.]

Bat Queen: I made home in forest. I'm here to take the lost. The forgotten.

Luz: I understand. But Owlbert is not forgotten. He has someone at home who loves him very much.

Bat Queen: [Turns and walks away.] He will not go back with you.

Luz: That's not your decision to make.

Bat Queen: [Turns back around.] I won't let him.

[Luz gasps, then braces for an attack. Owlbert protects her, and hoots. His eyes glow. A second later, so do Bat Queen's.]

Bat Queen: You...

[Wind howling.]

Bat Queen: You care for her.

[Owlbert nods, hoots. He nuzzles Luz, warbling.]

Bat Queen: Very well. Go. And take your friends.

[Willow and Gus, still being attacked by the bat babies, run in. The Bat Queen Whistles. Her babies, screeching, flies to her.]

Gus: I don't think I'll ever be clean again.

[Owlbert grabs Eda's staff and brings it to Luz. Gus wipes the bat babies' spit off of him.]

Luz: Bat Queen, do you know what happened to your owner?

Bat Queen: It has been thousands of years. I've forgotten.

Luz: If you ever want to search for the truth, I'll help you.

Bat Queen: Thank you. [Flies away.]

Willow: I can't believe you took on the Bat Queen. [Hugs Luz.]

Gus: [Dances.] And we're not dead.

Luz: Thank you for helping me get Owlbert back. I'm sorry we missed the game.

Gus: Are you kidding? That was better than any grudgby match. There were action-packed trials. I got to do my flag wave, and I'm slightly traumatized. Hooray!

Luz: [Chuckles.] Let's get this little guy home.

[Cut to the Owl House, where Luz is putting a bandage on Owlbert's cracked head.]

Luz: And now you're a part of the boo‐boo buddy club.

[Owlbert hoots.]

Eda: Owlbert, why are you off the staff?

[Owlbert hoots, flies over to Eda. Warbling.]

Eda: Luz took you to get ice cream? Aw, that's... a horrible lie.

[Owlbert hoots. Luz gulps.]

Eda: Well, lucky for you both I don't care right now. I'm going to take a nap. [Walks off.]

King: I'll, uh, be at the playground. [Walks away.]

[Owlbert flies back to Luz's shoulder.]

Luz: [To Owlbert.] We'll keep this one to ourselves, shall we?

[Owlbert warbles, nuzzles Luz's cheek again. Cut to Eda's room, where four empty elixir bottles are sitting on her side table.]

Eda: [Coughing, picks up a bottle.] The elixir... It isn't working on the curse anymore. This is bad. [Coughing, vomits.] When did I swallow a swing?

[Cut to Bat Queen's nest, where she is chasing her kids.]

Bat Queen: Babies. To bed.

[The bat babies land on a branch, chirping. Soft screeching.]

Bat Queen: And now it's time to have book before sleeping. [Burps.]

[She takes a book out of her mouth. Instead of reading it, she rips off pages and feeds them to her kids. The bat babies begin soft screeching. Their soft screeching continues.]

Bat Queen: Yes, consume. Grow wise.

[A baby bat swallows.]

Bat Queen: Avoid paper cuts.

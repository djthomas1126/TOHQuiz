Luz: [Finishes drawing the glyph.] Alright, maybe it's this one!

[She activates the glyph, and a monstrous claw sprouts from it. Luz, upon seeing it, screams in surprise and backs up. Eda instantly bursts through the door, with her staff in hand, and destroys the claw, which turns into goo which splatters Owlbert, King, and Luz.]

Luz: Safe! [Both her and King wipe the goo off their faces.] Thanks, Eda. [Grabs her notepad and a pencil.] That was.. definitely not the one. [Crosses out the glyph on her notepad and labeling "NO" next to it.]

[Eda picks up the petrified Beefy Bob and it crumbles.]

Eda: Eugh. [Shivers.] What are you doing out here?

Luz: I started going through Philip Wittebane's diary again. Since my trip with Lilith, I found out that a lot of his margin doodles were actually unfinished glyph combos. [Sighs and looks down dejectedly.] I thought maybe they could help with the portal door but... [The claw rises again but is swallowed by Hooty.] no luck.

Eda: Maybe it's for the best. I don't like that you're still thinking about that creep.

Luz: [Sighs.] I know. [Curls up and pulls her hood up.] I just miss my mom. [King looks at Eda and points at Luz.]

Eda: [Kneels down.] Let's take a break, huh? [No response from Luz.] Maybe... I could tell you... a story? [Luz instantly approaches Eda's face with a look of curiousness.]

Luz: [Excitedly.] Like a backstory kind of story?

Eda: Yes. [Luz sits excitedly with King in her arms, him holding her echo mouse and Hooty circles around them.]

Hooty: Hoooooot!

Eda: This is the story of how I met the coolest, baddest, kick-buttiest witch of all time: Raine Whispers.

-THEME SONG, but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.-

[Cut to Young Eda holding a pack of flashcards in her hands; the first one says, "Things abominations probably shouldn't do." The second card says: "The Titan's five humors"]

Young Eda: Okay. Titan's five humors.

[Scene cuts to the two Clawthorne sisters walking but only their feet are seen; Young Eda is kicking a grudgby ball.]

Young Lilith: Hmm... Earth, bone, blood, bile and, uh... [Sighs.] I always forget the last one! It's on the tip of my tongue, it's...

Young Eda: [Eagerly.] It's... [Starts making a snake-like sound.]

Young Lilith: [Slowly.] Snakes...?

Young Eda: Breath! [Breathes on Young Lilith and laughs.]

Young Lilith: Eda, you have smilk breath. Gross!

[Young Eda continues laughing and walks away. Young Lilith follows her.]

Young Lilith: Give me another question.

Young Eda: Alright, alright. On Scaburary 40th, the day Belos declared the Isles an empire... [Kicks the grudgby ball towards Young Lilith.] Think fast!

Young Lilith: [Catches the ball with her hands in mid-air.] Eda, we don't have time to play around. [Hands her the grudgby ball and takes the flashcards.] Tryouts for the Emperor's Coven are just around the corner.

Young Eda: [Balances the grudgby ball on her head; chuckles and snorts.] Seven months isn't "just around the corner".

Young Lilith: Your turn. It's a half-moon, and you're mixing a leadfoot potion. What ratio of Blackroot Quills to Iron Ash do you use?

Young Eda: Is it a waning or a waxing moon? [Draws a spell circle in the air and a stem starts to sprout from her head.]

Young Lilith: Oh, uh, I-I don't think that matters.

Young Eda: Yeah, sure it does! [The two stop walking.] I-If it's a waxing moon, it's a 2-to-1 mix, but if it's a waning moon, the Blackroot Quills lose their umph, and you gotta double down to a 4-to-1.

[Eda traces another spell circle in the air which makes the stem shrinks down to a seedling and catches the grudgby ball. She then plucks off the seedling and blows it away. Meanwhile, Lilith checks her notes.]

Young Lilith: You're correct. [Dejectedly.] On both accounts. Huh. [Walks to Young Eda excitedly.] Imagine us both getting in. We'll train together.

Young Eda: We'll prank together. [Takes the flashcards and tosses them in the air; but Young Lilith summons them and they go nicely into her hand.]

Young Lilith: We'll study ancient history together. [Eda twirls her around.]

Young Eda: We'll kick [Kicks the grudgby ball upwards.] butt together!

Young Lilith: [Catches the grudgby ball.] Help demons and witches together!

Young Eda: [Dances around a post.] Take over the world together! Nothing can stop the Clawthorne sisters! Our rivals shall be crushed beneath our feet! Even the Titan shall gasp in fear!

[Young Lilith suddenly gasps.]

Young Eda: Yeah. [Snaps fingers.] Like that.

Young Lilith: No! [Points upwards.] Look! We're gonna be late!

[Young Eda looks upwards, just in time to see the minute hand of the clock above her move to 12. The clock bell starts tolling. Young Eda gasps, then jumps off the ledge and runs after Lilith, both rushing towards school. At Hexside, students are seen at the front of the school as Eda and Lilith run in. A couple of students are seen walking and sitting on the grass, one being Young Perry. At the stairway, Young Darius flicks an abomination ball into Young Alador's face, and both and Young Odalia laugh.]

Young Eda: See? [Punches Young Lilith's arm.] We're gonna be fine.

[The school bell rings. A ring of fire suddenly appears in the doorway which bursts into a huge fire. Several students gasp and turn around. From the fire, out comes Principal Faust, and his neck slowly turns around as the fire behind him extinguishes. He then grabs a clipboard and scratches it with his pointy fingernails. The students start to hurry inside.]

Principal Faust: Detention. Detention. Suspension! [Scratches loudly onto the clipboard as a younger Bump walks over.]

Vice Principal Bump: Principal Faust, don't you think you're judging these students a touch... harshly?

Principal Faust: Not at all. These students are already late to being early, and that's a slippery slope.

Vice Principal Bump: [Nervously.] But if you keep expelling students, we won't have a graduating class.

[Principal Faust's head turns around slowly with a crack. Bump winces and starts sweating.]

Principal Faust: I'm just enforcing school policy.

Vice Principal Bump: That you added to. Y-You expelled the captain of our grudgby team because his shoes didn't meet your "appropriately squeaky" regulation.

Principal Faust: [Unfazed.] Too squeaky? A distraction. Too quiet? Can't hear them. Can't trust them. Some students are... irredeemable.

Vice Principal Bump: None of them are beyond redemption. [Nervously.] I would stake my career on it.

[Principal Faust's head slowly turns around with a look of curiosity once more with a crack when a flying grudgby ball starts attacking both of them.]

Principal Faust: What is that thing?!

Vice Principal Bump: Ow, ow, ow!

[Scene slowly pans to Young Lilith and Eda sneaking in the bushes as Young Eda draws a spell circle which moves the bushes aside to reveal a small secret door hidden. Young Eda opens the door for Young Lilith but they see someone coming. Young Lilith signals for her to go through the door but the door is quickly shut in her face which makes her groan in pain. Young Eda rearranges the bushes hastily as she is met by an angered Principal Faust and Bump.]

Young Eda: [Humming.] Hey, Fausty. Vice Princey B.

[Scene reveals both Bump and Faust looking angry as the latter holds up the flying grudgby ball with a smoking back. Cut to the principal's office. Eda is sitting down looking curious.]

Principal Faust: Miss Clawthorne? Do you know why I keep you around?

Young Eda: My innate talents? My unbeatable charm?

Principal Faust: [Quickly.] No. [Pulls a string hanging beside him; a stack of books land in the table; Eda looks at them.] Because to fight evil, you must understand evil. All your misdeeds, pranks, schemes, they have given me insight into the depravity that lurks within the minds of children.

Young Eda: Wow, this is really shocking. [Curious.] I thought there'd be more. Hmm.

[Principal Faust grabs and scratches a file folder with Eda's name on it, and starts reading it while pacing back and forth.]

Principal Faust: You're close with your sister, Lilith, I see. Plan on trying out for the Emperor's Coven, together? Commendable.

Young Eda: [Lies on the chair.] Yeah, I do kinda rule.

Principal Faust: Too bad you'll be ineligible... when I expel you!

Young Eda: [Sits up; shocked.] What?! You can't do that, I'll be separated from Lily!

Principal Faust: Maybe you should've thought of that before you filled the detention pit with green gelatin. [Shows her the file folder.]

Young Eda: [Defensive.] It was his birthday! He liked it! Please, Principal Faust, I'll do anything!

[Principal Faust chuckles and knocks on the wall behind him; part of the wall slides and Bump comes out.]

Vice Principal Bump: Uh, yes, sir?

Principal Faust: No child is beyond redemption. Didn't you stake your career on it? [Bump stares at Eda, who chuckles and waves nervously.]

[Scene cuts to the hallway of the school. Principal Faust's shadow is seen looming from above, and several students start to hide, run away and scream at the sight of him.]

Principal Faust: Every year, Hexside participates in a special training program called Instructing Future Witches of Tomorrow. [When they reach the locker, Faust slides the glass door open and takes a ribbon from a statue inside.] I attend with our most gifted students and we return with blue ribbons as a testament to my... [Admires the ribbon he's holding and realizes what he said.] I mean, our excellence. [Young Eda looks at Bump, who just looks at her worriedly.] Unfortunately...

Vice Principal Bump: You expelled our most gifted student for chewing too loudly in the cafeteria.

Principal Faust: Disgusting monster. [Turns around with his head bending at 90Â° sideward; it goes back into place once he's faced Eda.] This year, you can represent Hexside. Bring back a blue ribbon, and you can remain a student here. Come back empty-handed, and I will savor the expulsion. [Eda's face scrunches.] [To Bump; quickly.] And you'll go with her! [Walking away.] If anything goes wrong, I might have to find a new vice principal.

[Cut to black. At the convention center, where IFWOT is being held, a line of people are waiting to get their badges, among them are Bump, who is reading a pamphlet, and Eda, looking bored.]

Young Eda: I can't believe I agreed to this.

Vice Principal Bump: This will be fine, perfectly fine. You can go five minutes without setting anything on fire, right? [Scene cuts to Eda having summoned a small fire on her fingertip; upon seeing Bump looking at her, she quickly extinguishes the flame.] I know you have a reputation around school, but I just see a talented young witch. And I'll wager those stories about you turning the school inside out are just urban legends.

Young Eda: That was a fun day. [Bump looks away annoyed then grabs something out of his pocket.]

Vice Principal Bump: Let's try this. [He squishes a toy octopus.] This is a stress toy. [He hands it to Eda who takes it.] Anytime you feel the urge to cause chaos, just squeeze. [Eda squishes it too hard until it pops, surprising Bump; cut to the two walking towards the entrance of the center, Eda putting on a name badge.] Prepare yourself, Edalyn. The IFWOT is a battleground of magic and skill. Witches who successfully complete these courses have gone on to do incredible things. You will face some of the greatest competition here.

Young Eda: Hmph.

[Bump and Eda enter the center expectantly to find everything unexpectedly boring. One side of the IFWOT banner falls off. A Coven Scout is testing the mic when it suddenly spins and ringing noises come out from it, causing him to cover his ears. One student from Glandus High gets a food from the snack bar and he tastes it, but immediately dislikes it.]

Glandus High student: Ugh!

[He looks around, and seeing no one, he leaves the food back in the bar and walks away shyly. Cut to two professors sitting on two chairs, both looking bored; one of them is about to drift off. Cut to a weirded-out Eda and a not-so-surprised Bump.]

Vice Principal Bump: Wow. I grossly misjudged the tone here.

[The ground suddenly rumbles. Vines suddenly wrap the stage until it grows a stem and its head, which splits open. A much younger Terra Snapdragon appears from it. Everyone looks at her in wonder.]

Terra: Greetings, students, educators! My name is Terra Snapdragon, [Bows.] Head Witch of the Plant Coven! But today, I'm head proctor for the... [Looks up, and sees the IFWOT banner, and looks at it with disdain.] IFWOT? Seriously?

[She snaps her fingers and vines begin to cover the IFWOT banner (which eventually makes the Coven Scout repairing it fall from there) and it is replaced by vines and pretty flowers sprouting from it.]

Terra: I'm here to "Help Enhance Coven Know-how"! Welcome.. to HECK! [Minimal applause.] Oh, this is my first year hosting, and I am thrilled. Today, you little sweet peas will go through your rigorous exercises that will enhance your intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are you excited?

[The audience cheers.]

Terra: Lovely! Remember, this won't be a bed of roses. [A Coven Scout appears and opens a suitcase with blue ribbons inside.] Only the best of the best will be rewarded. The failures will be ground into mulch for my garden!

[Everyone is shocked and terrified by this. A Glandus High student then starts bawling. Just then, a Coven Scout comes and whispers to Terra.]

Terra: Illegal? Oh, we'll see about that, won't we, children? Let the activities begin! [She throws some petals and the audience cheers again.]

[Eda looks at Bump; he just gives her a thumbs-up. Cut to a scene where Eda is walking to a stand labeled "TRUST".]

Instructor: Tell me, what makes the covens strong? Strength in numbers? A dark pact? Well, it is all of those things but also, [He demonstrates a trust fall with a Coven Scout.] trust. Trust in our fellow covenmates. So, we'll begin doing trust falls. Any volunteers?

Young Eda: [Confident.] Sounds easy enough. [She raises her hand and walks to the front.]

Instructor: Very good, very good. And this will be your partner. [In front of her is a blob-like student, much to her dislike.] Now, you close your eyes, and trust that your covenmate will catch you.

Blob: Whoo! [Eda groans and turns around; she lets herself fall but her body passes through the blob.] Hm?

[The blob looks down to find the upper part of Eda's body has turned into a skeleton; everyone runs away screaming. The blob starts crying.]

Blob: Not again! [Sobs.]

[Eda's body suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke, and she suddenly reappears on the back of the proctor and blob.]

Young Eda: Ta-da! I'm here all night, folks.

[The instructor and the blob glare at her angrily; the proctor writes something on his clipboard. Eda's face changes from triumphant to disappointment. Cut to a part of the venue, where Eda is looking at her drink with disdain.]

Young Eda: I never should've come here. [She sips on her drink but is disgusted by the taste.] Blech! Even the free junk is junk!

[She throws the drink away but it is stopped by an unseen force. A younger Raine, wearing a St. Epiderm uniform, walks over.]

Young Raine: I don't know who you are, but you are a riot. [They hand the drink back to Eda; she takes it.]

Young Eda: Uh, no, I excel at functions such as these. Didn't you see how impressed everyone was when I faked my death? I even love the horrid liquids they serve.

Young Raine: [Chuckles.] Yeah, they always give us the off-brand junk. Let me try something. [They walk over to Eda's cup and they whistle in it.] Don't worry, I didn't spit in it.

[Eda tastes the drink and finds it tastes better.]

Young Eda: Whoa! [Sips more.] Hey, that's actually good! How'd you change the flavor?

Young Raine: [Walks over and sits on a cardboard box next to Eda.] Little trick I taught myself: changing the chemistry of a liquid with sound waves. See, bard magic can be cool! People just don't give it a shot!

Young Eda: [Chuckles and snorts.] All right, I get it. If you whistle loud enough, can you make all this.. less of a drag?

Young Raine: [Bored.] I wish. This is my third time. Always the same boring activities, same boring faces. [Screams upon seeing Eda's head, which has turned into a skull.]

[Eda's head suddenly turns into Raine's direction, and with a puff of smoke, her face is back.]

Young Eda: Till wittle ole me? [Blinks twice.]

Young Raine: [Laughs.] Yeah. [Continues laughing.]

[Eda suddenly spots the ribbons tied on Raine's side and is shocked.]

Young Eda: How'd you get those?!

Young Raine: [Holds up the ribbon for her to see.] Oh, these are from last year. [Tucks the ribbons back into their side.] Maybe if you stick with me, I'll show you how to get one of your own.

Young Eda: All right, I'm Eda Clawthorne. [She holds out her hand.]

Young Raine: Raine Whispers. [They take it, and both smile.]

[Cut to front of a stand which says "INTELLIGENCE". Four students are seated there, among them are Eda and Raine. A proctor points to the board, letting the students guess what is behind the question mark. Everyone starts drawing. The first student shows an illustration of planet Earth. The second student shows his drawing: an eyeball. Scene pans to Eda drawing something and reveals her drawing to be what looks like a butt. Upon seeing it, the proctor is looking disgusted and covers a student's eyes. Just then, Raine connects their drawing to Eda's, making their drawing a grudgby ball. The proctor reveals the answer, and upon checking it, he nods in satisfaction.]

[A flash of light appears, and scene cuts to Raine and Eda in front of a stand that says "CREATIVITY". They are seen assembling a miniature Rube Goldberg machine, which resembles the words, "THIS STINKS". Upon being seen by one of the proctors, he growls angrily. Eda then starts the chain reaction of the machine, which ends with a fountain of water transferring from a cup to another cup held by Raine, who gives it to the proctor. Upon drinking it, he gives the duo a thumbs-up, satisfied by the drink. Both then fist-bump.]

[Scene then cuts to a stand called "STRENGTH". Eda and Raine, along with their opponents, are dressed a sumo wrestlers. They face each other's backs, then, at the Coven Scout's whistle, the teams walk off in different directions. The opposing team turns around, but stops. Scene cuts to Raine rolling Eda like a bowling ball towards the opponents, who are knocked out like bowling pins. Raine walks over and the two do their special handshake, ending it with a fistbump. Scene then cuts to the two catching and playing a grudgby ball outside the convention center.]

Young Eda: I wonder what I'll get a ribbon for. Strength. Wit. [Poses with her foot atop the grudgby ball.] Radiance.

Young Raine: You'll get one for being a dingus!

Young Eda: Well, you're gonna get one for -- think fast! [She kicks the grudgby ball towards Raine, only for them to catch it swiftly and throw it back to her. Eda blushes.] Why do you come here? You're not like the other kids. You're -- I don't know, you're cool. [Throws the ball to Raine; they catch it.]

Young Raine: St. Epiderm isn't cheap. But if I make the school look good, I get a scholarship. What about you? [Throws the ball back to Eda; she also catches it.]

Young Eda: Made a deal with the devil. [She spins the ball on her fingertip.] Our principal's gonna expel me unless I come back with a ribbon.

Young Raine: [Chuckles.] Chance at redemption?

Young Eda: Nah, [She sits down looking discouraged; Raine walks over and sits next to her.] I think I'm being used to embarrass our vice principal. As if he doesn't do that to himself already.

[Cut to Bump looking at his clipboard. Someone goes towards his direction and looks like he is trying to hi-five Bump, but he turns out to be talking to a Coven Scout behind Bump, making him feel embarrassed.]

Young Eda: It stinks, but, I've got a sister at Hexside. She's kind of my only friend. It'd be a bummer if that got taken away.

Young Raine: Well, [They nudge Eda.] you won't have to worry about that. After the closing ceremony, we're home free. [Eda chuckles.]

[Cut to the stadium. The students are walking towards the center. Eda looks at Bump, who is holding a stress toy and still looking worried. Eda simply hold two fingers up, which calms Bump down. Vines start to sprout from the stage and a head which splits open once more as Terra appears.]

Terra: Congratulations, students! It seems nearly everyone earned a ribbon. [Two Coven Scouts appear and hold a small glass tray with ribbons.] You must be so proud of yourselves.

[Raine offers to hold their hand out to Eda; she takes it. Terra's mood immediately and suddenly changes from polite to sinister.]

Terra: Well, you shouldn't be. [The students gasp.] This training camp is a joke. There was nothing "challenging" about those challenges! And this... [Holds up Eda's drawing of a butt earlier.] was the last straw!

[She tears up the paper angrily. Everyone in the crowd gasps as Eda and Raine wince and look at each other.]

Terra: Before we hand out any ribbons... I think we need one more activity.

[Everyone gasps as a hedge-like maze traps the students inside it.]

Terra: We'll play my personal favorite game: Covens vs. Wilds. [The students look on worriedly.] Look at your badges, and you'll see if you're a Coven Witch [Eda's badge places her in the Coven group.] or a Wild Witch. [Raine's badge places them in the Wild group; They let go of Eda's hand.] Coven Witches, you have 20 minutes to capture every Wild Witch. [Both teams back up and face each other angrily except for Eda and Raine.] If you succeed, everyone on your team gets a ribbon! Wild Witches, you may earn a ribbon... if you put on a good show. And to encourage your shrinking violets, I'll allow any use of magic! We're in HECK, people! Let's have some fun!

[Cut to black. Back inside the maze, everyone from both teams start attacking each other; Terra looks at them lovingly.]

Terra: Ugh, I would've been such a good mom.

[Eda and Raine continuously dodge all the attacks and with one last look at each other, they go their separate ways. Raine draws a huge spell circle on the floor; they tap it and a burst of light emits from it. Eda shields her eyes and upon uncovering them, escapes. She uses her magic to block all attacks against her as she flees, and makes a Wild Witch trip over. An abomination looms behind her, to her surprise, but then transforms into a staircase as Eda climbs on top of it, and pounces from a side of the maze, landing back in a free area. She hides behind the wall as two Wild Witches run past her and she sighs. Eda looks back at Bump, who shrugs.]

Cyclops demon girl: Don't move!

[Eda is taken by surprise as she comes across two of her fellow Coven Witches.]

St. Epiderm student: Wait. She's one of us. [To Eda.] Come with us. We've got a plan to catch all the Wild Witches.

Young Eda: I'm not goin' anywhere! This is crazy! That plant lady is off her gourd!

Cyclops demon girl: Don't you want a ribbon?

St. Epiderm student: My parents say if I don't come home with a ribbon, I better not come home at all. [He three look behind them to find a fellow Coven Witch dragging a Wild Witch tied in red rope.] They're just watching out for my best interests.

Cyclops demon girl: So, I heard there's this one kid who's been coming here for years.

St. Epiderm student: Yeah, that's Raine, my classmate! Somehow they always have the best juice! And they don't share it with anyone!

Cyclops demon girl: I heard they're one of the strongest witches here. And they're a bard! Crazy, right?

Young Eda: Not really. Bard magic can be cool.

St. Epiderm student: If we take them out, the rest should be a breeze. You with us?

Young Eda: Uh...

Cyclops demon girl: We'll take that as a yes! [The two drag Eda away.]

[As Terra watches the battle in satisfaction, she notices a newly imprisoned Wild Witch being dragged by a Coven Witch.]

Terra: Welcome, welcome. Oh, don't look so wilted. You've got great seats now. [The Wild Witch is tossed aside with all the other Wild Witches.]

Vice Principal Bump: Uh, Miss Terra?

Terra: Head Witch Snapdragon, if you please. Enjoying the show?

Vice Principal Bump: Yes. Well, your show is actually in violation of several school rules, convention hall safety guidelines and child safety acts. I'm sure it's an honest mistakes so why don't we just stop this activity and-- [He shows her the rule book but it is promptly destroyed by Terra's vines.]

Terra: I make the rules, sweet pea. Oh, looks like there's only one crafty little Wild Witch left! [Raine is then shown running across the maze passing several other unconscious Coven Witches.] Will the Covens win? Or the sprout?

[Eda, the Glandus High student and the St. Epiderm student walk sneakily.]

Cyclops demon girl: That must be the bard.

St. Epiderm student: We'll surprise them.

[They both hide in separate walls, looking out for Raine. Eda is about to pass them both, but the St. Epiderm student pulls her out just in time for Raine to come running. They are being chased by a Coven Witch, and is eventually cornered. They inhale deeply and loudly whistle as the Coven Witch is blasted and knocked out onto a wall. The Glandus High student motions for the St. Epiderm student to attack. They both come out of their hiding place as he summons a large amount of water which knocks Raine onto a wall and making them drop onto their knees. Raine cowers, terrified, as the Coven Witches surround them.]

Cyclops demon girl: We got ya now.

St. Epiderm student: For the Covens! [He summons another amount of water and is about to attack Raine when suddenly, both he and the girl are suddenly lifted into the air by an unseen force.]

Young Raine: Huh?

[Eda is revealed to have lifted the two into the air as she walks over to Raine with a devilish expression on her face.]

St. Epiderm student: What are you doing?! [He and the girl are tossed aside by Eda.]

Terra: An interesting development? A showdown, perhaps? Let's give them plenty of room to fight!

[She makes the maze disappear as everyone starts shouting "Fight!" Bump is in turmoil as he continuously squeezes multiple stress toys in both of his hands. Raine and Eda stare at each other angrily. Both are about to punch the other and yell as Terra watches in anticipation. But when they stop, they instead do a fist bump as they perform their special handshake which leads to them creating a spell circle which emits a flash of light, aiming at Terra. She blocks the attack with her vines, but some part of the fire reached her hair; she puts it out.]

Terra: Never a rose without a few thorns, I see.

Young Eda: Yeah, well, we got tired of your stupid little challenge.

Young Raine: And your plant puns!

[An offended Terra is slowly lowered down by the head of the plant as she angrily walks towards Eda and Raine, both of which are nervous. Then suddenly, Terra laughs.]

Terra: Delightful! [Raine and Eda are surprised.] Feisty witches do make the best leaders! I especially like you, sprout. [Pokes Raine's nose.] But... I can't reward disobedience. So, everyone is poisoned! [She raises her vines but a Coven Scout appears and whispers to her, making her irritated.] That's illegal too? [The Coven Scout nods.] Ugh! Fine. Instead, no one gets a ribbon this year, everyone loses!

[Everyone starts booing, particularly at Eda and Raine.]

Young Eda: I hope this was worth it.

Young Raine: Actually...

Vice Principal Bump: Eda! I am so proud of you! But also, [Raine winks at her and leaves.] I think we're toast. My career is over, and you'll probably be expelled and end up selling garbage at the Night Market but, what a way to go! [Terra, who has seemingly overheard the conversation, taps Bump's shoulder, surprising him.]

Terra: Pardon me. Expelled? Is Fausty still playing more of his little games? No. [Approaches Eda.] Budding prodigies like Miss Clawthorne need to be nourished. I'll let him know I was quite impressed... with both of you. [She walks away as Bump faints in shock.]

[Cut to a few days later, at Hexside, in the cafeteria. Eda is carrying a lunch tray and wearing her letterman jacket. She is seen looking around for Lilith and gasps in happiness upon seeing her. She walks over to a bored Lilith.]

Young Eda: Lily! I finally caught you. I never got to tell you about that weird training thing over the weekend.

Young Lilith: Uh-huh.

Young Eda: I was horrified. If I lost, I was gonna get expelled and then we wouldn't be able to-- [Lilith's watch rings.]

Young Lilith: Ah, shoot! [Stands up and grabs her empty lunch tray.] Sorry, Edalyn, gotta go. E.C. study group is meeting. We can... talk later?

Young Eda: Go. Go, go, go, don't be late. [Lilith walks off.]

[Eda is now looking bored and alone. She takes a sip of her Ghoul Aid drink and is disgusted by the taste.]

Young Eda: Blech! Ugh. [An unknown student offers her an Apple Blood drink.]

Unknown student: Trade?

Young Eda: Huh? [She looks up. To her surprise, the student is revealed to be Raine.] Raine?! What are you doing here? Oh- oh no, your scholarship!

Young Raine: Don't worry. I wanted to transfer out of Epiderm anyway. And apparently, my parents always hated the cold on the Knee. So? [Shakes the Apple Blood drink for her to take.]

[They swap drinks. Cut to a view of them outside the school's window.]

Young Raine: Okay, Eda. Give me the run down on this place. [Tastes the Ghoul Aid drink and finds it disgusting.] Blech!

Young Eda: [Chuckles.] Oh, you'll love it. It's got all the secrets. And since Terra spoke to Principal Faust, I can get away with pretty much anything! [Tastes the Apple Blood drink.] Mm! I've never had Apple Blood before, this stuff is good!

[She continues sipping it as Raine watches her lovingly. The flashback ends. Back in the present, Eda is looking up at the sky warmly.]

Eda: And after that, we were inseparable.

[She turns to see her audience, all of whom have fallen asleep on her lap. Eda grabs Luz's notebook, where she has drawn Eda and Raine themselves as teenagers. Under the drawing are the words, "NO! GETTING SLEEPY! MUST RESISS--" with a trail of pencil from it. Eda smiles at the drawing, then looks back at the sky.]

Eda: [Sighs.] Raine, you better be okay.

[Cut to the Emperor's Castle. Raine is sitting on a ledge, looking into the distance when Terra interrupts them and they turn around.]

Terra: Ah! There, you are sprout. [She arrives holding Raine's drinking horn with tea in it.] You know, I was just heartbroken when I found out it was you, of all people, causing trouble for the covens. But look how well you're doing now.

Raine: [Groans.] I just wish these headaches would go away.

Terra: [Hands them the drinking horn.] Keep drinking your tea, and you'll forget all about the pain.

[Raine blows (and whistles) into the tea lightly, and they drink it. Terra is watching them with a look of satisfaction. After they finish, Raine hands her back the drinking horn.]

Terra: Have a good night, Raine. [She walks away.]

[As soon as she disappears, Raine immediately stands up with a look of determination on their face. After cracking their neck bones, they knock on a brick on the wall beside them, and the brick slowly disappears as a small abomination with a golem on its head (reminiscent of Darius) appears and hands them a letter, which they open.]

Raine: A draining spell? This is worse than we thought. Any way to counter?

[The abomination passes them a small note. It reads, "OWL LADY".]

Raine: I told you, I'm not putting her in danger again. We'll figure something else out.

[They whistle into the letter as it slowly dissolves into ashes and the abomination retreats back inside the brick. Raine lets the wind carry the ashes as they look up into the sky with a hopeful expression on their face.]

Raine: I'll keep you safe, Eda. I promise.

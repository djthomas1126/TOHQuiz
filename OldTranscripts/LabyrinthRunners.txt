Illusion teacher: Very nice work. And how is working with your partner?

Young Gus: No prob. We're practically best friends now.

Illusion teacher: Then I think you'll do just fine in this class. [Walks off.]

Young Gus: [Proudly.] You've done it again, Augustus. [Looks at the skeleton.]

[Two students then walk in, both from the illusion track. One of them, the dark-haired boy, is holding two books between his armpits as he listens to his friend speaking.]

Orange-haired student: Yeah, I killed it in fantasy grudgby this weekend.

Dark-haired student: You just.. didn't do the assignment?

Orange-haired student: I got the new prodigy to do it for me. And all I had to do was pretend to be his friend. Hmm?

[Someone sniffles, which is revealed to be Gus, upset that someone only used him to do the assignment. He dispels the illusion, grabs his bag and runs away in tears.]

Orange-haired student: Aw, come on, dude! It was just a joke!

[Gus runs inside a classroom and sits down dejectedly.]

Young Gus: You've done it again, Augustus. Why does this keep happening? [Bangs his head accidentally on the desk behind him; a book from above it hits him.] Ow! [His eyes turn blue.] Oh, no. No, no, not this!

[Illusions of the two students who he encountered earlier escape from behind him and he projects a wide illusion of the forest as the two students approach him.]

Orange-haired student illusion: [Laughs.] Aww, the poor wittle baby got his feewings hurt.

Dark-haired student illusion: Talent can't make up for gullibility. [The two laugh at Gus, making him feel more dejected.]

[Just then, they hear another voice, attempting to communicate with Gus.]

Unknown student: Um.. [Different voice.] Hello there. [An abomination waves slowly at Gus; its hand suddenly melts, revealing the bone of a finger.]

[Someone chuckles and reveals themselves from another desk; it turns out to be a younger Willow.]

Young Willow: Sorry, I- I was trying to be funny, but, I just ended up being horrifying. I.. thought I was the only one that hid here.

Dark-haired student illusion: Uh, who's that?

Orange-haired student illusion: You might as well just do her homework now. Get it over with.

Young Gus: [Covers his head.] Go away!

Young Willow: [Confused.] Are you talking to me?

Young Gus: All of you!

[Willow smiles, pushes through the illusion and sits beside Gus.]

Young Willow: Hey. Sometimes I get wrapped up in my own thoughts too. But my dads taught me a little trick to quiet the voices.

[She starts inhaling, her hands counting from 1 to four, and exhaling as her hands count back to 1. Gus follows the second time, and after, his eyes turn normal again. The illusions start to disappear.]

Orange-haired student illusion: Huh? No, no, I don't wanna go!

[He and the dark-haired student scream as they disappear and the wide illusion disappears. The classroom returns back to normal.]

Young Willow: I'm Willow. [Offers her hand to him; he takes it.]

Young Gus: Augustus. [The two shake hands.]

-THEME SONG, but it is cut short and only shows the show's title-

[Outside the principal's office, Mattholomule walks out, having joined the illusion track, and walks off proudly. The Blight twins also come out, Edric having joined the beast keeping and potions tracks, and Emira, the healing track. Edric proudly presents his new colors to Emira as they hi-five each other and walk off. Cut to inside the principal's office. Principal Bump is rummaging through folders in a drawer, and the illusion teacher looks back proudly.]

Illusion teacher: It's nice to see the kids embracing multitracks. I remember giving up everything for illusions. [Looks dejectedly at the illusion coven sigil on her wrist as she hands a folder to Bump.]

Principal Bump: To be honest, I thought this would be more trouble than it's worth. But I haven't seen students this enthusiastic, ever.

[A hooded person suddenly walks inside, catching the illusion teacher and Bump's attention.]

Hooded person: Well... trouble.. might be closer than you think. [Shows a medallion with the illusion coven brand on it.]

[Cut to the cafeteria. Amity shows Willow and Gus the messages from Luz on her game device.]

Amity: These are the last messages I got from Luz. [Cut to a view of the trio, looking worried.] She must've typed them quickly, because all I could decipher was, "Learned a lot of bad stuff," something, something, "Day of Unity," something, something and, "Don't scare 'em away"? I don't know what any of it means.

Gus: What about all those hearts? [Amity quickly blushes.]

Amity: Oh. [Chuckles.] Those are for me.

Willow: I went by and checked out the Owl House. It was crawling with Coven Scouts. I was thinking of capturing one for information, but...

Amity: It's okay, Willow. They're tough. Not everyone can stand up to them.

Willow: [Squints suspiciously.] But I didn't want to bring any more attention to Luz and Eda.

Amity: Oh! [Awkwardly.] Of course, yes. Smart move.

[From somewhere, the bell screams and rings. Amity picks up her food tray and walks off with a decent expression on her face, as Willow follows her with a dejected expression.]

Gus: [To Willow.] Hey. You should say something.

Willow: I'm fine. We just started hanging out again, and, she needs time to get to know the new me.

Gus: You mean the real you. [Winks at Willow.]

Willow: Mm-hmm. [She winks back and walks off.]

[As Willow walks off with Amity, Gus has just scooped up his lunch when he hears rattling from the trash bin. He turns around to look at it, and out comes Flapjack with a half-eaten sandwich on his beak and chirps.]

Gus: [Gasps.] I remember you!

[Flapjack chirps, drops the sandwich and runs off. Gus pockets his lunch, summons his staff and rides on it.]

Gus: Wait, get back here!

[Flapjack flies through the hallways as Gus follows him, and he eventually ends up in the Paranoratorium, Hexside's closed theater. Upon landing, Gus looks around, armed with his staff. Suddenly, someone comes up behind him, and he gasps. The figure steps forward. It's revealed to be Hunter, with a hood and looking rather disheveled.]

Gus: What are you doing here, Golden Guard?

Hunter: Wouldn't you like to know. [Chuckles.] But rest assured, Gus, I--

[Both hear clattering sounds as Gus looks behind Hunter, confused. Behind him, Gus spots a few packets of Hex Mix and a few books. Hunter instead attempts to hides it with his cape, embarrassed.]

Gus: I'll ask you one more time. What are you doing here, Hunter?

[Hunter doesn't speak until Flapjack flies across him and bites his singed hair, making his hood come off.]

Hunter: [Angrily.] Ow, ow, ow, ow! Okay, fine! [Stares angrily at Flapjack as he perches himself on Hunter's shoulder.] Truth is, my living situation has been compromised. Maybe. So I just need a place to crash. Temporarily! Hexside... was the only place I could think of.

Gus: How... vague of you. Do you know where Luz is, by any chance?

Hunter: [Surprised.] She's... not with the Owl Lady?

[Just then, Bump's voice rings out from the speakers.]

Principal Bump: [From speakers.] Students, please join me in the gym for an important announcement.

Gus: [Summons his lunch bag and hands it to Hunter.] I'm not sure what you're going through, but that much Hex Mix can't be good for your stomach.

[Hunter looks inside the bag to find an orange, an apple and a sandwich. Gus runs off as Hunter looks at him. Cut to inside the gym, where the students are gathered into a crowd. Gus enters.]

Viney: What's going on?

[Above the stage is the illusion teacher, the hooded figure from earlier, and Bump.]

Principal Bump: Uh, students, teachers, let me introduce the esteemed-

Hooded figure: Please, Principal Bump, I deserve no accolades.

[The hooded figure steps forward and takes off his hood.]

Adrian: Hello everyone, my name is Adrian Graye, Head Witch of the Illusionist Coven.

[The students gasp and start muttering worriedly.]

Adrian: Unfortunately, I'm not here with good news. The Emperor's Coven has plans to stop multi-track studies, by inducting every Hexside student into a coven, before the Day of Unity.

[Everyone gasps in shock. Viney, Barcus and Jerbo look at each other worriedly.]

Mattholomule: Mother Titan! [Rips off his sleeves and crosses his arms grumpily.]

Principal Bump: Don't worry. No one's magic is going to be sealed away. Head Witch Graye supports us, and has come to help.

[Upon hearing this, Mattholomule takes back his sleeves, puts them on, and crosses his arms again, embarrassed. A teacher then comes up to Edric and takes him by the shoulder.]

Adrian: Before any Coven Scouts come by, I'm going to make illusions of sigils on your wrists. [A hesitant Edric is led into the stage.] They'll be temporary, and harmless.

Edric: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, I just started the other tracks. Are you sure this is safe?

Adrian: Don't worry, once a scout sees the fake sigil, they'll move on, and you can continue your studies in peace. [Edric, still hesitant, rolls up his sleeve and shows his wrist.] Now hold still.

[Adrian draws a spell circle in the air and aims it towards Edric's wrist. Gus gets suspicious of this, but then he sees illusion magic brandishing Adrian's hand. Gus realizes this is a trap.]

Gus: [Gasps.] Stop! [Everyone looks at him.] Don't trust him! He's hiding behind an illusion!

[Gus draws a huge spell circle, and aims it towards the stage. The illusion dispels and Adrian is revealed to be a Scout Captain in disguise. Edric fearfully shields his wrist as the illusion teacher and Bump step forward and protect him. The illusion teacher and the captain draw spell circles simultaneously, when suddenly, the real Adrian's voice can be heard.]

Adrian: Cut! [The teacher and the Coven Scout call off their spell circles in surprise.] Just... just cut.

[From the bleachers in the gym, Coven Scouts start appearing, to the shock and disturbance of the students. Some Coven Scouts also appear on stage too, a few handling the lights, and a few handling vocals. The real Adrian then appears, in a director's seat, in the middle of the stage. Adrian is holding a cup of coffee and looks like he's about to laugh.]

Adrian: All right, couple of notes. Tom, [Walks over to a Coven Scout.] that Adrian illusion was lacking a certain, hmm? You get me? [Tom shrugs in confusion.] Severine! That was really... poor, work. You're on thin ice. [Severine whimpers.] Captain, [Walks over to the captain, who was pretending to be Adrian.] the read of your last line was just a little... mm. [Gestures.]

Guard Captain: I don't know what that means.

Adrian: [Hands him the cup of coffee and winks.] You'll figure it out. [Teleports beside Gus and grabs his arm.] And you. Well, you just ruined any chance we had of making this, something.

Gus: You were gonna trick us into getting sigils! [He attempts to escape Adrian's tight grip unsuccessfully; a Coven Scout puts a Branding Glove on Adrian's arm.]

Adrian: Uh, yeah. I work for Belos. Kind of my job. But let's make sure you [The sigil on his glove changes from Illusion to Abomination.] can never use your little illusion tricks again... [Sinisterly.] shall we?

[Everyone gasps, horrified. Gus attempts to escape Adrian's grip again as he slowly reaches for his wrist.]

Gus: No, no, stay back! I said, stay... back!

[The word "back" echoes, and his eyes glow blue again. He projects yet another wide illusion, but this time, the illusion keeps shifting locations, confusing everyone. Everyone starts running in different directions. Adrian looks at Gus, astonished.]

Adrian: How are you doing this?!

[Gus attempts to escape his grip again. Just then, Hunter passes through the illusion and pushes Adrian out of the way, taking Gus with him as they both disappear. Adrian recovers, then uses an earring that looks like a mirror, draws a spell circle with it and steadies the illusion. It has brought him and a few other scouts, however, into the Looking Glass Ruins.]

Guard Captain: Head Witch. It looks like the whole school is covered in a giant...

Adrian: ...Illusion. Hmm.

[He walks over and examines a statue. When he touches it, however, it simply passes through his hand. He smirks.]

Adrian: Find that boy, the one who.. did.. this.

Guard Captain: This is a complicated spell. I-If we could have some direction...

Adrian: Am I the only one who knows how to do their job? Just figure.. it out! [Scans the statue again.] Would you look at this? The detail is just so... pow!

Guard Captain: I hate working for this guy.

[Cut to black. Cut again to the shifting illusion. Willow and Amity run through it as they attempt to escape. Eventually, the illusion steadies and they are seen in the carnival.]

Amity: Whoa, what? How did we get here?

[The two start to look around as Amity summons her scroll. Willow walks towards a nearby wall and touches it.]

Willow: I think it's an illusion.

Amity: I just got a text from Ed. He, Bump and a bunch of others are in the Healing Homeroom. [Makes her scroll disappear.] We should find our way over.

[A Coven Scout suddenly looms behind Willow.]

Amity: Willow, watch out!

[She attempts to draw a spell circle in the air, but the Coven Scout is suddenly trapped in vines, having been summoned by Willow.]

Willow: [Chuckles.] I got it.

Amity: Lucky shot, Willow. [Walks off.]

[Willow stares at Amity, concerned.]

Coven Scout: Hey, don't listen to her. You totally got me.

[In another place somewhere at the school, Hunter and Gus are also running through the shifting illusion, when it finally steadies and they are seen somewhere in the streets of Bonesborough. Suddenly, they bump into a wall, which actually turns out to be one of the lockers, and they fall to the ground.]

Hunter: [Groans.] Why are we here? [Gus stands up, and he becomes astonished.] Whoa, Gus. Wha-- Is your eye okay?

[One of Gus's eyes is revealed to be blue; he rubs his eyes in confusion and looks again. Cut to Gus's perspective; the blue eye can see through his illusions while the other cannot.]

Gus: My spell, it's still active.

Hunter: [Stands up.] Well, you're a witch... unspell it.

Gus: No, I- I don't know how, I've never made one this big before.

Hunter: Well, if we're still in Hexside, [He guides himself through the wall.] we should find a teacher. [Gus follows him as the two walk off.] Maybe they'll know how to help.

Gus: Hunter, why'd you save me back there? From getting a sigil? Don't those guys work for you?

Hunter: I owed you. For the food. [They stop at a staircase.] Are these real steps or illusion steps?

[Hunter tries skipping over it, but immediately falls down the stairs, groaning. Gus looks horrified.]

Hunter: [Weakly.] Real steps.

Gus: [Walks down the stairs; guiding himself through the wall beside him.] When we first met you were trying to trick me into joining a coven. And now you're helping me stay away from one... 'cause of a.. sandwich?

Hunter: [Walks away.] It was a good sandwich.

Gus: No sandwich is that good. [Follows Hunter, who still refuses to speak.] Come on, if we wanna find a way through this, we need to trust each other. What's going on with you?

[The two eventually stop walking. Hunter is about to say something until someone interrupts them.]

Hunter: I..

Coven Scout: Hey! It's the kid!

[Upon spotting two Coven Scouts in front of them, Hunter immediately summons his staff and attacks one of the scouts, but gets intercepted when abomination goo, summoned by the other scout, takes his staff and traps his body in goo. The scout attempts to take the staff, but it immediately transforms into Flapjack and flies around him, trying to distract him.]

Gus: Hunter! [Tries to run towards Hunter but is restrained by the other scout in vines.]

[A Coven Scout approaches Hunter but stops upon recognizing him.]

Coven Scout 1: Wait, aren't you the Golden Guard?

Coven Scout 2: Seriously? Dude, what the heck? We're on the same side.

Coven Scout 1: Our deepest apologies, sir. [Calls off the abomination goo, freeing Hunter.] The Emperor sent out a search party for you, he's been worried sick.

[At the mention of Belos, Hunter immediately flinches, and tries to hide it.]

Hunter: [Hesitantly.] You don't say...

[Flapjack immediately flies towards Gus and begins chipping his vines. Meanwhile, Gus spots some leftover abomination goo in front of his feet.]

Coven Scout 2: I'd be honored to escort you back to the castle, sir. I'm sure the Emperor would be thrilled to know you're okay. Say.. why aren't you in uniform?

[Gus is then shown drawing a fire glyph using the abomination goo in front of his feet and upon finishing it, activates it. Hunter is then shown looking nervous.]

Hunter: Uh, I--

[Before he can finish, a wave of fire hits the Coven Scouts, making them fall down. Hunter is taken by surprise as the wave barely passes him.]

Gus: Follow me! [Runs off; Hunter and Flapjack follow him.]

[The Coven Scouts chase after them as they run into a tangible wall, confusing the Coven Scouts. Scene then cuts to the two panting behind the door, and they are shown to be in Gus's room. Hunter starts panicking once more.]

Hunter: Oh Titan! He's looking for me! He'll know I'm here. I-I g-gotta run. I-I gotta hide! I g- [Breathing heavily.]

[Gus puts his hand on Hunter's shoulder, which makes Hunter stop hyperventilating and look up at him.]

Gus: Hey. Try to breathe. Like this.

[Gus repeats the technique that Willow showed him; he starts inhaling, counting from 1 to 4, and then exhales and counts back to 1. He repeats as Hunter follows along, eventually calming down.]

Gus: Did you run away from the Emperor's Coven?

[Hunter nods.]

Gus: Why?

[Hunter opens his mouth to speak, reconsiders, glares at Gus, then buries his face in his arms.]

Gus: Not too long ago, when I showed a little talent and started taking more advanced classes, it always felt like anyone who wanted to be my friend had an ulterior motive. Until I met Willow. And, eventually Luz, and some others. [He gets up and walks toward pictures of him with Luz, Willow, and even Mattholomule.] So yeah, not everybody's great, but not everybody's bad either, y'know? For what it's worth, you can trust me. I promise not to mess with you.

Hunter: [Scoffs.] That's not worth anything. Stop acting foolish.

Gus: All right, tough guy. Let's keep moving then.

[Gus walks through the wall, Hunter stands and looks at Gus's pictures, then turns to leave. The scene cuts back to Willow and Amity as a Coven scout is thrown across the screen. The Guard Captain then summons a rock scout from the ground and lunges it towards the girls.]

Willow: I got this! [Draws a spell circle on the ground.]

Amity: No, I got this! [She too draws a spell circle.]

[Willow's magic summons vines and Amity's magic summons an abomination, but the vines end up impaling the abomination; the rock scout nearly hits the girls, who dodge the attack as the rock scout slides through the wall.]

Willow: [Frustrated.] What are you doing?

Amity: I just got you back as a friend. Let me protect you!

[A bookshelf appears above Amity. It nearly topples on her before it's caught by Willow. She summons vines to both keep the bookshelf from crushing her, and knocking out the Guard Captain.]

Willow: [Grunts.] I don't want your protection! I want you to see who I really am!

[She pushes the bookshelf aside; the illusion teacher, Edric and Emira open a way out of the illusion as Bump appears in front of them.]

Principal Bump: Come quick!

[Willow runs past Amity, holding her arm in pain, Amity soon follows her. Scene cuts back to Gus and Hunter as they run into the school hallway.]

Hunter: Is this...real?

Gus: [Touches a water fountain and gets gum stuck on his hand; he groans in disgust.] Yes! Yeah, we made it through the illusion! High five!

[Hunter confusingly raises his hand to Gus, which he slaps, causing him to grunt; "Willow" is seen walking through the halls and stops as she notices the boys.]

Gus: Willow! You're okay!

Willow: Augustus! I've been looking everywhere for you! [Notices Hunter.] Whoa, what is he doing here?

Gus: Oh, don't worry. It's cool. He helped me escape from Graye. [Whispers.] I think he ran away from the Emperor's Coven. Also, he hasn't showered. In a while. Be nice.

Willow: Interesting. Anyway, let's find the others before these illusions get any more...[Squeals.]

[Hunter looks at her suspiciously.]

Gus: Okay, let's get moving.

[Hunter summons his staff and teleports in front of the two.]

Hunter: Who are you?

Gus: [Stands in front of "Willow".] What are you doing? Willow's on our side!

Hunter: That's not the captain.

Willow: You're scaring me, Hunter!

Hunter: Have you ever seen her play Flyer Derby? There's no way she'd be afraid of me.

[Gus starts to back away from her.]

Adrian: Oh, again? Cut!

["Willow" reveals that she is Severine in disguise.]

Adrian: Severine! [Severine squeaks in surprise.] You had your chance, and you blew it! Not that I'm surprised.

Severine: But I-I followed all your notes.

Adrian: Well, he was still able to see through your shoddy performance. So maybe you should've figured out the note inside the note. [Severine walks away, whining.] And you two, are making my job very difficult.

[Hunter and Gus run away from Graye, but are halted in their tracks by Belos.]

Hunter: [Fearfully.] Belos...

[Graye kicks Hunter to the ground and grabs Gus by the arms. He holds Hunter down with his foot and snaps his fingers to summon the two scouts casting Belos as an illusion.]

Hunter: I command you to stop!

[The scouts stop advancing on him.]

Scout: Technically, he is our superior.

Adrian: Well, right now he's just a runaway, and our dearest Emperor wants him back. So tie him up.

[The two pick up Hunter, who proceeds to kick the scout and headbutt the Captain.]

Guard Captain: [Groans.] Just put him-

Scout: Out of his misery? Gotten! [Draws a spell circle.]

Guard Captain: To sleep, dude! To sleep!

Scout: Oh, yeah. Right, right. [He summons a flute and plays a tune that expels a gas.]

[The gas causes Hunter to slowly close his eyes. When he opens them, the scene changes to the Healing Homeroom with Flapjack looking down on him, he is soon accompanied by Skara and Viney.]

Skara: He's waking up!

[Hunter sits up and rubs his head in pain. He looks around the room and is surprised. Cut to a view of the room. Barcus is licking a scar on one of his paws, while beside him is Jerbo, his leg being wrapped around with a gauze roll. Bump is damping a wet cloth onto Mattholomule's arm. Emira is then shown summoning a spell circle and holding it up to a part of Edric's scraped head. Willow is then shown getting her arm healed by Cat. After looking calm for a while, Hunter starts to get up.]

Hunter: [Gasps.] T-This.. This is an illusion! Gus! Are you- ah!

[He tries to stands up, but falls to the floor and groans. Viney and Skara help him up.]

Viney: Whoa! It's okay. Try not to stand so fast.

Skara: This isn't an illusion. You're in the Healing Homeroom.

[Bump approaches Hunter with a distrustful look on his face.]

Principal Bump: Well, Mr. Golden Guard.

Hunter: [Manages to stand up.] Hunter. [Flapjack flies up to him and perches on his shoulder.]

Principal Bump: We saw you being dragged around, and the flyer derby team was determined to save you. [Hunter looks at Skara and Viney, surprised.] But I am not yet convinced of your innocence. Where have your scouts taken Augustus?

[Everyone is now eyeing Hunter with suspicious and distrustful looks on their faces, except Viney and Skara.]

Edric: That's the Golden Guard?

Emira: [Whispers to Edric.] Dude looks sickly.

Mattholomule: [Pops out from behind Edric.] I could probably take him.

Barcus: [Barks and growls lowly.] [Subtitles: He's not to be trusted.]

Hunter: I- I'm not with them, I swear! I was with Gus the whole time. I was trying to get him to you.

Illusion teacher: Maybe we can trade him for Augustus. I'm sure the Emperor would want him back.

[Hunter flinches at this. Scene cuts to Willow, exercising her arm which had just been healed.]

Hunter: I'm not lying, Gus was showing me around. T-There was a sandwich, he showed me this breathing thing.

[Upon hearing about the breathing technique, Willow realizes he's not lying.]

Hunter: Please, you gotta believe me!

[Willow puts a hand on his shoulder.]

Willow: He's telling the truth. [Smiles at Hunter, then steps forward.] And he can help us drive Head Witch Graye and his scouts out of the school. [Looks at Hunter.]

Hunter: Y-Yes! Um, Graye said he'll be in the gym. But he will be guarded.

Amity: [Stands up.] That won't be a problem. Willow can bust through anything. [Willow smiles, now knowing Amity trusts her fully.]

Willow: Yeah. But I'll need help.

[Amity starts walking towards her but Mattholomule reaches her first.]

Mattholomule: Say no more, I'm on it. [Willow eyes him, annoyed.]

Principal Bump: [Sighs.] Let's just come up with a plan.

Skara: Yes! [Starts clapping excitedly.] This is my favorite part!

[Cut to outside the gym, which is enveloped in an illusion of a forest. Coven Scouts are guarding the door.]

Adrian: And yes, at first, I thought that fooling children was a waste of my impressive talents.

[Scene cuts to inside the gym, which is enveloped inside an illusion of the Looking Glass Ruins. Adrian keeps pacing back and forth in front of a captive Gus, being held by two Coven Scouts.]

Adrian: But I realized that a true genius can find the art in everything he does and-- [Realizes Gus is not paying attention to him.] Hey. Hey!

[The captive Gus is looking rather guilt-ridden and hopeless.]

Gus: [Sighs disappointedly.] You've done it again, Augustus. You can't even tell Willow apart from the fake one. [Adrian snaps his fingers in front of him.]

Adrian: Yoo-hoo. Come on. Are you listening? This is my monologue. Now, this- is- your- doing?

Gus: [Turns away guiltily.] Yeah. It's all my fault.

Adrian: Oh. Right. All about you. Now how about telling me how you know about the Looking Glass Graveyard? I've been looking for the Galdorstones. [Walks over to a statue and touches it.] They'd make great gifts for the Emperor. Where did you say you found them? [No response from Gus, who looks at him angrily instead.] Ah. Boring.

[He gestures towards the Coven Scouts and they hold Gus to the point where his arms are tied. Adrian then takes his mirror-shaped earring.]

Adrian: See this mirror? It's a handy little magic amplifier. [Draws a spell circle.] It'll help me sort through those little memories of yours.

[He then aims the spell circle towards Gus using the mirror-shaped earring. Gus starts writhing in pain.]

Gus: [Groans.] Ah, stop! Wait, this hurts!

Adrian: Oh, don't be so dramatic.

[The illusion all around the school dispels through a large orb, startling the Coven Scouts outside guarding. Back inside the gym, Adrian looks around.]

Adrian: Hmm. Well, that's one less thing to worry about. Now, where were we?

[Upon turning around, however, he discovers Gus's eyes are now both blue. He starts creating an orb that grows rapidly. Adrian and the others step back in shock. Back outside the gym, a Guard Captain looks towards his left, and spots Principal Bump walking towards them.]

Guard Captain: [Blocks the path.] Gym is off-limits. Graye's orders.

Principal Bump: Graye may be Head Witch, but I'm still principal. It'd be wise to let me through.

Guard Captain: [Chuckles and aims his spear towards Bump.] Oh, yeah?

Principal Bump: [Frewin comes out his head and aims it towards the guard captain.] Yeah.

[Behind him, an illusion dispels. Hunter, Willow, Amity and a few other students then appear, with a few abomination and creatures, like Puddles. Upon seeing this, the Guard Captain immediately whistles and a few other Coven Scouts appear behind the battalion.]

Guard Captain: Get 'em!

[The fight commences. A Coven Scout attacks first, but Bump blocks him with magic. Another Coven Scout appears and attempts to attack Hunter, but he simply teleports behind him and he shoves the Coven Scout off. An abomination attempts to attack another Coven Scout, but he slashes it. Suddenly, Puddles lands on top of him, with Viney and Skara riding him.]

Skara: Yeah!

[She attacks an incoming Coven Scout beside her, but a vine suddenly wraps Puddles's leg, causing both Skara and Viney to get thrown away. Emira immediately runs over and starts to heal Skara. A Coven Scout attempts to attack them, but he is suddenly countered by an abomination summoned by Amity, who smiles at them; they smile back. She runs off, controlling the abomination. Behind her, Edric and Barcus carry a handful of potions which they throw at the Coven Scouts. Jerbo is shown chasing after some Coven Scouts with his own abomination. Mattholomule is then showing defending himself, summoning walls which the incoming Coven Scouts hit. Afterwards, he blows away his spell circle and smirks proudly. Just then, the wall behind him cracks as an incoming Coven Scout attempts to attack him, but is suddenly trapped and raised by vines, summoned by Willow as she flings them. A Coven Scout attempts to attack beside her but Hunter teleports behind him and throws him away. A wave of energy summoned by the Guard Captain suddenly hits everyone, ending the battle.]

Guard Captain: Enough! I will NOT be cowed by a group of students!

[A mix of abomination goo and vines suddenly hit his face; he is then trapped in a wall. Willow and Amity step forward as they call off their summons.]

Willow: Then how about just the two of us? [She and Amity pose together.]

Amity: Nice one!

[Hunter suddenly runs in front of them and out of sight. Unbeknownst to everyone, the guard captain pulls out an Abomaton controller and presses a button on it. Hunter kicks the door open to find the glowing orb, Adrian and the two Coven Scouts lying on the floor in pain.]

Adrian: [Groans.] Make it stop. Make it stop! I don't.. like these memories... [Lies down to reveal a curled-up Gus.]

[Willow and Amity rush inside.]

Amity: What's going on?

Willow: Gus is trapped in his head! And the others are being affected too!

[The three suddenly hear loud thumping and turn around. Scene then reveals an Abomaton tearing his way inside the gym. All the other students behind it are now trapped in abomination goo. The Guard Captain enters with the controller.]

Guard Captain: [Laughs.] I needed a reason to play with one of these!

[The Abomaton advances on the trio and starts revealing its weapons.]

Amity: I really have to talk to my parents about this. [She and Willow summon their palismen.]

Willow: We'll hold them off. You save Gus.

Hunter: But- how?

[Hunter looks at Gus determinedly and runs towards the orb as Willow and Amity begin fighting the Abomaton. Hunter passes a groaning Adrian and sees Gus, his face buried in his knees. Right after his staff morphs into Flapjack, he touches the orb, and flashes back to some of his memories inside Belos' mindscape. He struggles to fight it and eventually does, pushing through the illusion and reaching Gus. However, when he touches his shoulder, the background immediately changes and shifts through various locations again. He then finds himself inside the forest, but turns around and spots Gus, inside the detention room, looking guilty.]

Gus: What's wrong with me? Why can't I learn?

Hunter: Gus! [He approaches him only for the background to change into white. He turns around again, and finds illusions of Bria, Gavin and Angmar circling around Gus.]

Gus: I let myself get tricked... again.

[The whole illusion vanishes as the background changes into white once more. Hunter turns around again to find Gus staring to himself in three mirrors.]

Gus: Everyone thinks I'm the smart one. So why do I keep acting so dumb?

Hunter: Gus, can you hear me?

[The illusion fades again. Hunter, seemingly lost, looks around and steps back. The background now changes to show Gus's room. The real Gus appears, burying his face in his knees.]

Gus: I can't even trust myself anymore. [Hunter sits beside him.]

Hunter: It's... hard, when you can't trust yourself. I spent my whole life believing I was doing something good for someone good... but it was a lie. And some part of me still wants to.. believe in that lie, just like you wanna believe you're dumb, or, whatever. But it's not true. [An anguished Gus raises his head and looks at him.] I promise. I wouldn't mess with you. Uh, now, uh, how did that breathing thing go again?

[He starts inhaling deeply and whistling, which makes Gus laugh. Gus's blue eyes return back to normal, and the illusion finally fades completely. Hunter and Gus stand up and look around. Willow, Amity and a few other students manage to subdue the Abomaton. Willow and Amity look at each other and grin, then turn around and see Gus and Hunter.]

Willow: Gus! [Runs towards him and hugs him.] Aww, I'm so glad you're okay!

Gus: Me too.

[Hunter attempts to walk away sheepishly but is pulled into a hug by Willow and Gus, much to his embarrassment.]

Willow: Thanks, Hunter.

Hunter: [Blushing.] What is.. this?

Gus: Just go with it.

[Cut to outside the school. The Coven Scouts preapre to leave. Two of them are dragging a traumatized and whimpering Adrian inside the ship. The Guard Captain looks back.]

Guard Captain: When Emperor Belos catches wind of this...

Principal Bump: [Proudly.] I'm sure he'll be thrilled to learn one of his captains was defeated... by a couple teenagers.

[The captain groans, then sees Severine walking away.]

Guard Captain: Severine! Get on that ship or you'll be walking back to the castle!

[Severine has finally had enough.]

Severine: You know what? It has been a rough year, and my self-esteem can only take so much! I quit! [Throws her mask to the floor, revealing her cat-like head and walks away.] I'm going back to the Tiny Cat Coven.

[The whole school starts cheering and clapping as the ship finally leaves. Hunter and Gus watch it leave as they are approached by Willow and Amity.]

Amity: [To Gus.] I can't believe you took down a Coven Head.

Gus: Yeah. And I almost went down with him.

Hunter: Is Graye gonna be alright?

Gus: Uh... [Shrugs.] probably? [He and Hunter chuckle.]

Skara: Hunter!

[The four turn around to see the students approaching Hunter.]

Skara: What's going on at the castle?

Viney: Did you actually leave the Emperor's Coven?

Edric: Have you ever sneezed with your mask on?

Barcus: [Barks.] [Subtitles: The people crave the truth.]

[Hunter looks hesitant at first, but then looks at Gus; they both smile.]

Hunter: [Inhales deeply. To Skara.] Everyone in the castle is traveling to the head for the Day of Unity. [To Viney.] I... think I did. [To Edric.] Yes?

Edric: That's gross, man.

Hunter: Listen. Emperor Belos has been lying to everyone. The Day of Unity isn't about the Titan or magic. It's much scarier than that.

[Everyone has worried expressions on their faces upon hearing this. Willow and Amity look at each other, then hold hands.]

Hunter: Sorry... there's a lot to explain.

Principal Bump: [Approaches Hunter.] Then you'd better get started.

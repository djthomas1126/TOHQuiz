Luz: Wow, King. This looks great!

King: Thanks. I- I hope they like it too.

[Someone knocks on the door.]

Hooty: Hooty-hoot! We have visitors!

[What Hooty said grabs Luz's and King's attention.]

King: They're here!

[Scene cuts to Eda going up to the front door and open it. Hooty is seen wearing a bowtie. Outside the door stood a mustached demon wearing a fedora which resembles King. Two tiny demons which resemble King then pop out from behind him. Cut to kitchen where Luz gathers up some dirty dishes and take them away from the stove. Owlbert flies into the scene wearing a top hat. Eda brings the mustached demon and his children over to the kitchen. She is also wearing her Grom outfit.]

Eda: Welcome to the Owl House, folks. Hope this place wasn't too hard to find.

Mustached demon: Not at all! Thank you for having us.

[King runs up to greet the mustached demon.]

King: King of Dads! You made it!

[King and his dad proceed to give each other a hug.]

King's dad: Wouldn't have missed it for the world, son. I'm so happy we saw that video of yours. Now, maybe after dinner, we can have a nice game of catch.

King: [Excitedly.] Really???

King's dad: [To his children.] Prince of Brothers, Prince of Sisters, do you have something to say to your big bro?

King's siblings: Big brother!

[King's siblings run up to give King hugs. King hugs them back. Cut to Luz, King, Hooty, Owlbert and echo mouse waiting over at the table.]

Luz: Please have a seat, Your Honorable Mr. King of Dads. King prepared a special feast for you all.

King's siblings: Hungry!

[King's siblings run up to the table, climb up the bench and attempt to grab food, which captivates Luz. King's dad approach the table from behind them.]

King's dad: [Laughs.] Patience, children. It would be rude not to [Tips hat.] give thanks first.

King: Oh! Oh! I can start! [Clears throat.] I'm thankful that my demon family finally got to meet my owl family.

[Everyone becomes happy and look at each other after hearing that.]

King: Seriously, thi- this is amazing! I- It's almost like... a dream...

[A sudden realization hits King and he looks up at everyone sadly.]

Eda: King...

[The screen turns white. Cut to King curling up on the floor sleeping with an uneasy expression on his face. Eda puts her hand on King and calls out to him.]

Eda: King... King, come on. It's time to wake up.

King: Nyeh! [Jolts up.] What's going on? Is there trouble?

Eda: We're about to find out.

[Eda and King peeks out from the doorway. Cut to Luz kneeling down in front of a table in the living room with a sad expression on her face.]

Eda: Luz is ready to talk.

-THEME SONG, but it is cut short and only shows the show's title-

[Scene begins with a flashback moment from inside Belos' mindscape, when the Collector shows themself and moves their way towards the portal, changing into multiple abstract forms forms along the way.]

Collector: Let's slash and rend and crush and bruise! Let's curse the land in nine bright hues!

[After reaching the portal, the Collector transforms into a picture form depicting nine people lifting up their hands in a worshipping position. They then transform again to depict a screaming Titan and people being shattered into pieces.]

[Scene changes to show the moment Luz becomes angry after Hunter gets sucked into the ground.]

Luz: I'm gonna tell everyone about the Day of Unity, that you've been lying about the Titan for years!

[Scene changes to show Inner Belos picking up a broken Golden Guard mask.]

Inner Belos: I'll do anything to save humanity from evil.

[As Inner Belos is about to finish his sentence, the scene transitions into a hyper-realistic pencil drawing of Luz depicting a manically grinning Inner Belos holding up the mask, with the words "Witch Hunter!!" written beside it. The camera zooms out to show two other pencil drawings on the table, one depicting the portal and one depicting the picture frame from Belos' mind showing past moments, Philip Wittebane, and Belos' mask.]

[Scene changes to show King and Hooty looking at Luz with a shocked expression on their faces. Eda looks down at the drawings, hand clasping over her mouth. She then looks up at Luz. Cut to Luz sitting across the table staring back at them, looking despondent. She is covered with a blanket and holding a cup of hot drink. King's toy plushies is stacked behind her.]

[Cut to Eda facepalming herself.]

Eda: [Inhales deeply.] This is just a lot to take in.

Luz: We don't have time to take anything in. We have to stop Belos! I- I was a part of his plan! I-I fell for everything!

[As Luz speaks, she stands up and hugs herself. She then becomes emotional and starts tearing up, almost on the verge of crying.]

Eda: King, Hooty, you know what to do.

[King and Hooty go up to hug her.]

Eda: Well, one thing's for sure. People can tell when you've been inside their head. It's only a matter of time before Belos sends his scouts over here. You need to hide.

Luz: I'm not hiding. I'm gonna stop Belos from completing the Draining Spell. I... just... need to figure out how.

[Lilith suddenly appears at the door way along with Owlbert.]

Lilith: Edalyn!

Hooty: Lulu!

[Hooty immediately stretches towards Lilith, accidentally tightening his body around Luz and choking her.]

Lilith: I came as fast as I could. Owlbert filled me in on the Draining Spell. Oh, Titan, I can't believe this is what the Day of Unity was about the whole time. Ugh, I was such a fool, a dolt, a chump, a-

Eda: Hey, no pity parties in this house. Besides, Luz is upset enough as it is.

[Luz turns around and stares at Lilith, teary-eyed, whimpering.]

Lilith: You're right. I'll do anything to help.

[Hooty gets really close to Lilith and squishes her face.]

Hooty: Lulu! I am so happy to see you, I could- I could...

[Something goes up from inside Hooty's stomach towards his mouth as he makes a retching sound. In the process, King gets dragged by the garbage.]

King: Weh?

Hooty: Oh, here it comes!

[Hooty proceeds to throw up some garbage and spirits he had swallowed before on the ground (and unintentionally, King).]

Luz: Ugh! Gross.

Lilith: Oh, my word!

Eda: Hooty, you gotta stop eating garbage from the ground.

[King finds a letter addressed to him among the pile of garbage.]

King: Huh? WEH! [Emerges from the pile.] He's also been eating our mail. Look!

[King opens the envelope and takes out a letter. A piece of rock falls out from the letter into his hand.]

King: [Reading the letter.] "Dear King Clawthorne, if you wish to know who you truly are, come to this location and meet our warrior clan." [To the others.] I think they might be my family! And maybe they're an answer to all our problems!

[Scene focuses on the bottom of the letter showing the map of the location.]

Luz: That's incredible! But... how is it supposed to help us stop Belos?

King: They're a clan of warriors! How else do you defeat a tyrant with their own army? By making an army of your own!

Lilith: Well, it's... not like we have many allies.

Luz: Not to mention it's a chance for King to find out where he came from. I say let's go for it!

Eda: [Skeptical.] Well, I say you two need a safe place to hide while the adults take care of things.

[Luz and Eda stare at each other angrily, then turn away from each other and make a "hmph" sound, while also crossing their arms.]

Lilith: I'm actually in favor of this plan.

Eda, King and Luz: [Surprised.] You are?

Lilith: It wouldn't hurt to check. Plus, [Stands up and walks away.] judging by King's map, you two would be taken far, far away from the Boiling Isles and Emperor Belos.

Eda: What if something goes wrong?

Lilith: Hooty could accompany them. Their safety would be your responsibility, my dear, brave Hootsifer.

[Hooty becomes touched by Lilith's words and starts tearing up.]

Hooty: I would protect these silly children with my life!

[As he speaks, he stretches towards Lilith and bows before her; Lilith does a small curtsy in response.]

Eda: [Groans.] Yeah, well, how- how would they even get there?

Luz: I know a ship that might take us.

King: Yeah! The ole Selkidomus crew. Think about it! Belos won't be able to withstand a whole army of mes.

Lilith: Such allies would be quite valuable.

Luz: I wonder if I still have my sailor's hat.

Hooty: Does anyone feel that marching around the edge of the forest?

[Eda eventually relents.]

Eda: Fine. You can go. We'll find out all we can on our end to create a plan for uh... uh, when you get back.

[Luz stands up and runs towards Eda.]

Luz: Thank you, Eda! We won't let you down.

[Luz and King both hug Eda.]

King: Let's pack for the trip!

[Luz and King run off.]

Hooty: Wait for me!

[Hooty follows them from behind in his porta-Hooty backpack.]

Lilith: [To Eda.] You know you made the right choice, don't you? Plus, I've explored that area, there is nothing of note. Whoever wrote that letter was sending them on a wild Luz chase.

[Lilith proceeds to laugh at her pun, but Eda covers her face and starts crying instead.]

Lilith: Oh, no, no, no. No, no, don't cry! Oh, the joke wasn't that bad, was it?

Eda: [Crying tone.] Oh, this is so much bigger than I imagined, Lily. I thought Luz was just some lost kid, but because of me she's wrapped up in this thing with Belos and it- it's just not fair. She and King are children. They shouldn't have to deal with this.

[Lilith gives Eda a hug.]

Lilith: We have a whole week until the Day of Unity. We'll figure out how to keep them safe.

[Eda moves away from Lilith and smiles at her gladly.]

Eda: Alright, let's get to work. [Sheds off a tear.]

[Scene cuts to somewhere on the sea during nighttime. A ship passes in front of the camera and sails off at a high speed. Cut to someone shoving some coal into the furnace on the ship, making the fire grow larger. Camera zooms out to show Salty closing the furnace door and walks away from it, wiping away his sweat. He then leans on the handrail of a staircase where King is sitting at.]

King: Doin' a lot of work there, Salty. Where's the crew?

Salty: Well, I'm no longer working for the Golden Guard. So, me mates abandoned ship for greener, snailier pastures. They were like family to me too.

[After hearing what Salty said, King becomes sad and looks down at a photograph he is holding, which shows a drawing from inside the building of the Uncharted Island depicting a demon of his kind fighting an unknown creature.]

Luz: Land ho!

[Luz's shouting grabs King's attention. Cut to Luz on the front of the ship using Hooty as a telescope.]

Luz: Land ho!

[King approaches the duo from behind. Cut to the trio staring at a tall object in front of them.]

Hooty: Is that a finger? It's a long way from our Titan.

Salty: That's 'cause it's not from our Titan. This be part of a different beastie.

[Cut to Luz rowing away from the boat in a bathtub along with King and Hooty.]

Salty: [Waves.] Come back with a good story, sea squirts! If ye come back at all!

Luz: Aw, he's so supportive.

[Scene cuts to the bathtub being parked on the beach. Camera tilts up to show the trio going up a fleet of stairs.]

King: Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh!

[King arrives at the top but finds himself staring a wall. Luz and Hooty approach him from behind.]

Luz: Is anyone here？

Hooty: Maybe we're a bunch of early birds.

King: Or maybe they got sick of waiting! That letter was over a month old...

Luz: Hang on.

[Luz runs up to the wall and stops.]

Luz: There's something here.

[Luz notices a hole on the wall. She takes out the rock from King's letter and inserts it into the hole. This activates some sort of mechanism and sends some energy up the wall, creating a force field strong enough to rock the surface of the sea and Salty's boat. Salty shuts his eyes, then looks ahead in shock. Cut to the energy going all the way to the fingertip, creating a large circle which produces thunder and lightning. A blue light beam then shines through the circle and drags Luz, King and Hooty upwards.]

King: Whoa-

Luz: Ah!

King: Whoa-

Luz: Here we go!

King: Whoa!

[The trio goes through the circle. Cut to a dock at an unknown location. A lightning strikes the end from the circle at the cloud above, which then shines a blue light beam on the same location. The trio emerges from the light beam, but they are spawned in mid-air and immediately start falling while screaming. Cut to the trio on the ground, showing that Hooty had wrapped himself around Luz and King, cushioning their fall. The rock from King's letter falls from above and lands in front of Luz.]

Hooty: Luz, are you okay? Where's your other arm?

Luz: I only ever had two, Hooty. Did you think I had more?

[As Luz speaks, she lifts Hooty up and throws him to the ground. King jumps off and looks to his right. Luz then picks up the rock from the ground.]

King: Luz, look!

[The trio finds themselves staring at piles of bones and skeletons lying on the sea not far away from them.]

Hooty: That doesn't look like the Boiling Isles to me.

Unknown: That's because it isn't.

[The trio turns around to find a tall demon which resembles King walking towards them.]

Unnamed King-like demon: Welcome to the other side of the world.

[Cut to Luz and King giving the stranger a strange look. Hooty's mouth is wide open and he has a shocked expression on his face.]

Unnamed King-like demon: You dare trespass on this sacred-

[The demon notices King and gasps.]

Unnamed King-like demon: By the Huntsman, 'tis King! My name is Tarak. Hail and well-met.

King: Uh, y-yeah! 'Tis King!

Luz: Psst! King! Introduce us!

King: Right! Uh, this is Luz the human/friend/sister. And this is Hooty, the, uh, door...?

Luz: Your warrior-ship.

[Luz and Hooty bow at Tarak.]

King: Did you send me that letter? Are... A-are you my-

Tarak: Father? Alas, no. Nor is he here.

[King becomes dejected. Tarak walks up to him.]

Tarak: But I did [Squats down.] send the letter. And by the sight of you, I know he was one of us. He passed down that handsome skull of yours, didn't he?

[King giggles. Tarak stands up.]

Tarak: Now we celebrate! Everyone will be so happy to meet you.

Luz: Who's everyone?

[Tarak brings them over to a ledge and shows them a settlement down below.]

Tarak: Welcome to Titan Trapper Island!

[King gasps and his eyes light up.]

[Scene changes to show a view of the whole island from far away above the sky. Cut to Tarak bringing the trio into the settlement, with plenty of other demons which look like King around.]

King: I've never seen so many demons that look like me!

[He notices some warriors training nearby.]

King: Look at them go!

Tarak: We are Titan Trappers, under oath to protect the world from giant monsters of death and destruction. But uh, not many of us have seen a live one, of course. [Laughs and clears throat.] Come!

[Cut to Tarak pushing open a double door and leading the trio into a building.]

Luz: Aren't Titans extinct?

[Luz notices something in front and gasps. Scene changes to show a large skeleton of an unknown creature standing in the middle of the building, looming above everyone. There is also a spiral staircase right in the middle of the building.]

Tarak: Not all of them. The Grand Huntsman says one remains, so we sharpen our spears until the vile creature rears its head and a new hunt can begin!

[Multiple King-like demons walk up and surround the trio.]

Tarak: And now, dear King... you can join us and become a Titan Trapper yourself!

King: Weh?!

[Luz and Hooty gasp. Everyone around proceed to cheer.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh. [Kneels down.] King, that's amazing! [Stands up.] Well, we don't know any Titans, but the world could definitely use your help.

King: That's right! It's a lot to explain right now, but could you- I mean, we, help the people of the Boiling Isles?

Demon 1: Any enemy of yours is an enemy of ours!

[Everyone around proceed to cheer. They then whisk King away.]

Tarak: [To Luz.] But we can make no vows. For that you must beseech our elder, the wisest hunter of them all... Bill!

[Tarak gestures towards somewhere above.]

Luz: [Gasps.] Is that short for something?

Tarak: Nope. [Shrugs.] Just Bill. He's so cool, he actually met our god, the Grant Huntsman! He's my best friend. Eh, it's no big deal.

King: Luz! Luz!

[King runs up to Luz. She kneels down in front of him.]

King: Look what that gave me!

[King takes out a large hand-held object with a jaw at the top. The jaw then starts opening and closing.]

Luz: Oh! Oookay. That looks awfully pointy, buddy.

King: Don't worry. It's mostly paper mache. And bone. They're gonna show me their Titan Trapper ways, Luz! [Gasps.] I guess they're my ways, too.

[Luz leans forward and stares at King.]

Luz: How about Hooty and I go see the elder, and in the meantime, you learn all you can about being a Titan Trapper?

[King's eyes light up.]

King: This is a dream come true!

[As he speaks, King runs up to hug Luz. He then runs away dragging the object he was just given along the ground.]

Luz: Just be careful!

King: I will!

Hooty: [Looks at Luz doubtfully.] Are we really leaving him alone?

Luz: He should have time to get to know his family.

[Scene cuts to some King-like demons standing around King. They are all clapping while looking down at him. King has a joyous expression on his face. Luz and Hooty stand up while looking at them.]

Luz: Besides, [Turns around and walks away.] we have a job to do.

[Cut to the demons still clapping while looking down at King.]

Demon 1: Alright, King. Ready to become a Titan Trapper?

[King nods. After that, he is given a bat and uses it to hit a piñata, causing the candies inside to fall into the hands of the clan members nearby. Demon 1 pats King's head, making him feel touched. Then, he is taken to a hot spring, and he proceeds to stand under a waterfall on one leg as the clan members cheer on. After that, in another activity, he rides on Demon 1's shoulder and uses his sonic scream to shout through a horn. The sound waves hit a flying Griffin, causing it drop down temporarily before flying off again. Demon 1 then throws him over into another clan member's palm, who proceeds to put a headband (???) with a beard onto King's head before putting him on the ground. King's becomes delighted at this gesture.]

[Scene changes to Luz and Hooty looking up at something. Cut to them and Tarak standing in front of a door.]

Tarak: [Retreats.] I shall take my leave. [Comes back.] Tell Bill I said hi.

[Tarak retreats again. Luz then pushes the door open and goes inside with Hooty.]

Luz: Hello?

[Luz and Hooty look around, and Luz notices a sword in a wooden bucket nearby.]

Luz: Whoa. Look at all these stuff, Hooty! [Takes out the sword.] This will help us defeat Belos for sure.

[The blade then turns into dust, much to the duo's dismay. Luz turns around, notices a spear among the weapons displayed on the wall and gasps. She then goes up to take it.]

Luz: [Laughs.] Yeah!

[The end of the spear proceeds to spin, then becomes limp, much to Luz's dismay. Hooty gives Luz an unamused look.]

Luz: [Upset.] Hmm...

Bill: Tarak? Is that you?

[Cut to Bill sitting on his throne reading a book, titled The Last Titan: A Study of the Boiling Isles, written by Flora D'splora.]

Bill: I told you to stop rummaging through my stuff!

[Bill puts down his book. Luz walks up in front of him to show herself.]

Luz: Tarak's not here. It's just us. [Clears throat.] Uh, greetings. [Bows along with Hooty.] My name is-

Bill: What's that? [Pulls a horn and puts it over his ear.] Speak up! You barge in like an angry Titan only to whisper like the wind?

[Luz walks closer to him.]

Luz: Greetings! [Kneels down.] Uh, this... lowly traveler begs an audience with the great Bill.

[Luz crawls closer to the horn.]

Luz: Mayhaps we might [Puts her head into the horn, amplifying the sound.] perchance to venture to uh-

Bill: Oh, for the love of- [Pushes the horn aside.] Tarak sent you here, didn't he?

Luz: He said you were the wisest of all the Trappers. And also his friend. He says hi.

Bill: Of course he does. What do you want?

Luz: I'm here to ask if you would lend me your mighty warriors. You see, Emperor Belos has threatened to-

Bill: Ha! That upstart on the carcass Kingdom? He's no big deal. I've got battle scars older than his reign as Emperor! Wanna see?

[Bill lifts up his shirt to reveal a scar on his torso.]

Luz: We're good. But... please understand, Mr... Bill, a lot of people are in danger and- and they don't even realize it.

Hooty: Yeah, that dude is straight up evil.

Bill: Don't worry, we'll help.

[Luz's and Hooty's face lighten up.]

Bill: But if you think Belos is evil, you've never seen a live Titan. The children out there haven't either.

[The trio looks outside the window, but Hooty notices something to his right and stretches towards that direction. Cut to the King lookalike demons cheering at him as he stands in front of a waterfall.]

Bill: Don't know a thing about their ravenous appetites, or their terrible cries! Even their babies act like little monarchs. The last living Titan, I saw it once before it disappeared. Its hateful roar blew out my eardrums. How did it go? "Weh!"

[Luz suddenly realizes something.]

Luz: So, Titans are always hungry, act like monarchs, and say "Weh"?

Bill: The Huntsman wants us to find the last one.

[Bill gestures to a poster next to him. Scene then focuses on the title which says "THE LOST SON OF THE BOILING ISLES".]

Bill: Only a Titan's power can free him from his prison. But we've had no luck. Nice poster, right? I- I took a printmaking class once. Eh, not sure about the font though, I- I feel like the serifs are a little too...

[Bill turns away from Luz as he speaks. Hooty suddenly appears next to Luz and calls out to her.]

Hooty: Luz! Follow me!

[Luz walks away. Cut to Hooty lifting up a curtain. Camera zooms out to show a room in front of them. Scene changes to show some wall carvings and skulls which resembles King's species, and a shrine at the end of the room.]

Hooty: Oh, hey! Thought I'd get Lulu some souvenirs.

[Hooty uses his beak to grab a snow globe from a rack next to him and shakes it. Scene focuses on the globe, which has stars and a face which looks like the Collector in it. The Collector's laughter can be heard.]

Luz: [Realization.] Their god is that Collector kid?

[Bill lifts up the curtain and appears next to Luz and Hooty.]

Bill: Ah! You've found the shrine to the Huntsman. It's been my little DIY project for years.

[Luz raises her eyebrows.]

Bill: [Rolls up his sleeve.] You like our disguises? [Takes off his glove to reveal a hand.] You gotta look like a Titan to trap one. [Puts on his glove back.] But if I ever find that missing Titan, I'd hunt it down, tear it limb from limb, and mount its head in pride as we release the Huntsman! Then... we can finally go from being Titan Trappers to Titan Slayers! Say, who's your buddy's tailor? His costume looks so real!

[Luz and Hooty are completely shocked at what they've heard. Hooty opens his mouth in shock, causing the snow globe to drop to the ground and shatter into pieces. The duo then looks at each other. Cut to Luz retreating outside from the room.]

Luz: Uh... This has all been super cool, but I gotta go check on, um, things.

[As she speaks, she turns around and walks away from Bill while holding Hooty.]

Bill: But what about the uh... What were you talking about? Th- Th- The- Your quest. With Belos.

Luz: Oh, ha! I- I'm sure it'll work itself out. Really. Oookay, bye!!!

[Luz hurriedly leaves, but Hooty accidentally gets sandwiched in between the doors before getting pulled out. Cut to Luz running down a hallway.]

Luz: We gotta get King out of here now!

Hooty: Then run faster!

[Hooty stretches forward to make Luz run faster.]

Luz: I'm trying!

[Cut back to Bill inside his room with a suspicious look on his face.]

Bill: Hmm...

King: [Outside.] Weh!

[Bill's eyes grow larger and look to his back. Cut to outside the window where some clan members are throwing King up and down.]

King: [Outside.] Weh!

[Scene goes outside and nearer to the clan members throwing King up and down.]

King: Weh!

[Bill looks from inside the window with a look of sudden realization on his face. Cut to a room filled with weapons and mounted skulls.]

Tarak: Now... [Pushes the curtain aside and comes in with King.] Behold! Our armory.

King: Whoa! There's all sorts of things I shouldn't touch.

Tarak: Aye, for now. But when you grow older, [Chuckles.] I will be delighted to show you how to dismember your enemies.

King: [Eagerly.] You would do that??? Can you also tell me what this means?

[King shows Tarak the symbol which he carved onto the metal plate of his collar.]

Tarak: I- I'm not sure what that is. But... maybe we can find out together. I assume your father was lost in a hunt of yore. But a Titan Trapper is never alone. I'm just happy to see he passed down this. [Knocks on his skull.]

[King becomes teary-eyed and wipes away his tears.]

King: Can I ask a favor? [Sniffs.] It's a little silly, but, uh... Can we play catch?

[Tarak appears to be surprised by King's request. King looks up at him with teary eyes.]

Tarak: I believe you may [Points somewhere in front.] find some equipment thither.

King: [Gasps.] Thither?

[King runs off to the direction Tarak pointed at. A crow phone caws and approaches Tarak from behind.]

Tarak: Ah! Bill! Tis Tarak. What sayeth you friend?

Bill: [On the phone.] Shut it. Listen, that kid you're with...

[King finds a glove and a ball from a chest nearby. He puts on the glove and throws the ball upwards, intending to catch it, but the ball misses his hand and rolls away. King chases after the ball and picks it up, accidentally bumping into Tarak's butt.]

King: Tarak, I found them!

[The crow phone flies away. Tarak looks back at King with a shocked look on his face.]

King: Is... something wrong?

Tarak: Uh, our little game must wait. The time has come to celebrate your... uh... Induction into the Titan Trappers! Come!

[Tarak walks out of the room. King throws the glove and ball aside and runs after him.]

[Cut to outside somewhere on the island. Multiple King-like demons have gathered in front of a platform. Bill, Tarak, King, and two other demons stand on the stage. Cut to some demons banging on the ground with sticks. Cut to some demons putting a coat on King then back away.]

King: You don't have to go all out like this. I- I'm fine doing a small thing. Family and friends kinda thing.

Tarak: Your presence is very special to us, King. Now, we can release the Grand Huntsman from his prison and be granted power and glory!

[The audience cheers.]

Tarak: In the [Ignites a torch.] ashes of your old life, your destiny awaits. Carry this torch to the tablet and set it aflame.

[King takes over the torch from Tarak, then looks to his right at the tablet. He walks up to the tablet, hesitating for a bit, then sets it on fire. Immediately after that, the Collector's laughter can be heard, as a bright flash reflects in King's eyes before fading away.]

King: D- Did you hear that?

Tarak: The connection has been made. And now we can summon him.

Bill: Ah, you're taking too long!

[Bill rushes forward can covers King's head with a piece of cloth.]

Bill: Don't worry, child. We're almost done.

[As he speaks, he walks up behind King, then takes out a dagger and raises it above King's head.]

King: Then we get to play catch, right?

[Cut to a view from below the platform. Bill is still holding the dagger above King's head.]

Tarak: Uh, did you pull something, Bill?

Bill: [Trembles.] I can't move! Wh- wh- whoa! Wh- wh- who- [Screams.]

[Bill is suddenly lifted up by an unseen force and thrown aside.]

King: Weh? Wha- what's happening?

[A light ball appears above King's head, then gives out a bright flash. After the light fades away, King is gone from the stage. The crowd gasps.]

Tarak: Is this the power of a Titan?

Bill: No, you bonehead!

[Everyone turns around to look at Bill.]

Bill: It's that girl and her ungodly sock monster!

[Cut to somewhere on the island. Luz and Hooty take a deep breath and cancel out the invisibility glyph. They then lean back on a rock, panting.]

Luz: King, [Lifts King up; his cloth falls off.] I'm so glad you're okay!

King: [Angrily.] What're you talking about? We were just about to play catch!

Hooty: [Angrily.] Hey! Luz just saved your life!

King: Nyeh! [He frees himself form Luz's grasp and jumps to the ground.] These guys wouldn't hurt me. They get me! They know what it's like to be left behind.

Luz: King, if this is about your dad-

King: No! I mean, yeah, but it's you too, Luz!

[Luz is taken aback by what King said.]

King: You'll eventually go back to the Human Realm, I know how it works. I've read your Azura books. You even promised your mom. I just thought I had to... prepare for a world without you in it.

Luz: But they won't help. King, you're not one of them.

King: Then what am I?!

Luz: You're... you're a Titan, King.

[King becomes greatly shocked at what he just heard.]

Tarak: Hark!

[King looks to his left. Cut to Tarak standing nearby with a bunch of Titan Trappers behind him.]

Tarak: Tis the wretched spawn of-

[Bill emerges from behind Tarak and points at King.]

Bill: Shut up and get that Titan!

[Tarak immediately forms a spell circle and fires shots at Luz, King and Hooty.]

Luz: Come on, King!

[Luz immediately picks King up and runs away as Hooty swings wildly behind her. Cut to a view from above showing the Titan Trappers chasing after the trio. Hooty swings his body to shield Luz and King from the attack. A demon draws a spell circle and uses magic to snatch King off Luz's shoulder, bringing him over to them.]

King: Uh! Ah!

Luz: King! King!

[Luz chases after King, but he floats higher and out of her reach. Luz throws a light glyph at the demon and hits him in the face, creating a bright flash which temporarily blinds him. Without magic holding him mid-air, King immediately starts falling down as he screams. He then takes off his cape and uses it as a parachute, slowing down his fall. Cut to some Titan Trappers firing shots with spell circles while others throw bolases at Luz and Hooty.]

Luz: I gotcha! Ah!

[Luz tries to catch King, but is immediately attacked by shots fired by the Titan Trappers. Hooty shields Luz from the attack, then stretches upwards to divert their atention. He manages to evade some shots, but accidentally gets tied up by one of the bolas. He is then hit by multiple shots and falls to the ground.]

Luz: Hooty!

[Luz runs up to try and untangle the rope.]

Hooty: Tell Lulu... how brave I was!

[Tarak walks up to the duo and ignites a blue fire on his palm, intending to finish them off. Luz and Hooty looks up at him with a frightened expression. Behind them, King lands on the ground, then hops over the duo and pounces on Tarak, banging on his skull with his fists.]

King: Stop fighting! I'm one of you guys!

[Tarak grabs King and throws him to the ground, but King accidentally pulls off Tarak's skull. He notices this, gasps and looks back at Tarak. Cut to Tarak straightening up his body, and is revealed to be a witch.]

Tarak: You were never one of us. My brothers and sisters, a new hunt begins today!

[Everyone around proceeds to take off their skulls. Bill pushes Tarak aside and jumps in front of King.]

Bill: With this gift, the Grand Huntsman will return, and I shall ride cloaked in glory above all others! [Evil laughter.]

[Bill's words make everyone around look at each other uncertainly.]

Tarak: You mean, "we", right? [He takes out a spear and steps forward with an angry look on his face.] You promised the Huntsman will grant all of us glory.

Bill: Uh...

Hooty: Are Titans even evil?

Luz: How much have you been making up?

Bill: Uh... uh, don't let the girl fool you! I- I- I'm totally not lying. [Takes off his skull.] Hand me my spear!

[All the Titan Trappers give him a distrustful look.]

Bill: Whatever. Just gimme that thing!

[As he speaks, Bill jumps up to snatch the spear away from Tarak's hand. Before he can harm King, Hooty barges out from the ground below him and sends him flying upwards. The bolas wrapped around Hooty drops to the ground in front of Luz.]

Luz: Not today!

[Luz picks up King, turns around and runs away. King accidentally drops Tarak's skull to the ground. Cut to two Titan Trappers helping Bill up.]

Bill: Get off of me. And get that Titan!

[Cut to the trio running towards the platform where they arrived from, with the Titan Trappers chasing after them.]

Luz: Time to go home!

[Luz slams the rock from King's letter into the hole, reactivating the portal which pulls them upwards as the Titan Trappers watch on. Cut to them coming out from the other end, but they fall from a great height as Luz screams.]

Hooty: Hoooooot!

[Hooty extends his body and proceeds to wrap himself around the large finger nearby, successfully slowing down their fall and letting Luz and King land gently on the ground.]

Luz: We can't let them get through. We have to destroy this thing!

[Cut to the other side where a crowd of Titan Trappers run towards the platform and stop there. Cut back to Luz, King and Hooty.]

King: [Squints.] Then step back.

[King takes a few steps forward, takes a few deep breaths, then lets out a loud sonic scream. The sound waves create some cracks on the finger structure, causing the entire thing to come tumbling down. The portal starts shrinking as Luz picks up King and turns away, trying to shield him. Hooty then proceeds to wrap himself around the duo to protect them. The portal then explodes, creating a powerful blast which brings up a massive amount of dust and rocks the water in the ocean. The trio is then covered by a thick layer of dust brought upon by the blast. A while later, Hooty pokes his head out from the pile of dust.]

Hooty: Hoot!

[Hooty shakes off the dust and unwraps himself from the duo. They all look up in shock. Where the finger was at, there is now only a pile of rocks left, which is still smoking. King looks up at the rocks sadly. Luz and Hooty turn their heads to look at King, who then walks up to Luz and hugs her leg.]

King: [Crying tone.] I wanna go home.

[King starts tearing up. Luz and Hooty look down at him with a sad expression on their faces. Scene changes to show Salty's boat sailing on the sea. On the crow's nest, King looks down at the symbol on the metal plate of his collar. When he looks up, he sees the Boiling Isles' Titan's corpse in front of him.]

King: [Hesitantly.] Um... hi.

Luz: King!

[King looks down. Below, Salty is cooking something on a stove. Hooty is eating what appears to be a bacon strip from his plate. Luz holds up a plate with two eggs and a bacon strip and looks up at King.]

Luz: You want breakfast?

[King stands up, gives the Titan's corpse another glance, then turns around and walks away sadly.]

[Scene cuts to multiple Coven Scouts running up and surrounding something, each with a spell circle ready at their fingertip.]

Guard captain: [Steps forward; to the crow phone.] We have them surrounded.

Kikimora: [On the phone.] Good. Arrest anyone inside. For the Emperor.

[Scene changes to show that the Coven Scouts have surrounded the Owl House.]

Coven Scouts: For the Emperor!

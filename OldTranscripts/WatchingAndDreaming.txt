All: Huh?

[Ghost hisses. Cut to a view of the platform from further away, then to Gus, Willow, and Hunter. Pink strings drop down from above and wrap around their arms.]

Hunter: Huh?

[The trio gets dragged upwards. Willow and Gus gasp and scream as this is happening, with Willow briefly reaching upward to keep hold of Hunter's hand. Cut to Camila, Ghost, Clover, and Emmiline getting dragged upwards by similar pink strings. Camila cries out as she hugs the palismen tight. ]

[Cut to Luz and Amity.]

Luz: Mama!

[Pink strings wrap around Amity and drags her upwards, causing her to cry out in surprise. Luz tries to reach out her hand towards Amity.]

Luz: Amity!

[A bright flash suddenly appears behind Luz. She turns around to look at it, and is forced to shut her eyes as the flash was too bright.]

[The screen turns white. When the flash fades, the entrance to the In Between Realm appears.]

Luz: What happened?

[Luz's hand appears on screen as she tries to reach the portal.]

Papa Titan: [echoes] Hey!

Luz: We were— just about to enter the Archives—

Papa Titan: [echoes] HEY!

Luz: We were just about to rescue Eda and King.

Papa Titan: [echoes] Luz, the human!

[Cut to a close up view of the Titan's eyes and nose, still alive. Something which looks like Hooty can be seen coming out of his right eye.]

Papa Titan: You have to wake up.

[Scene turns white. Once the flash fades, Luz's face appear on screen, eyes shut. Her eyes then shot open. The sound of heartbeat thumping can be heard in the background. Cut to a POV from further away, which shows Luz inside the throne room of the Emperor's Castle. She is sitting on Belos' throne and wearing his outfit. Above her, the heart can be seen beating. The title of the show then appears on screen. The eyes of Owlbert logo in the letter "O" flashes blue before the title fades away.]

[Luz sits up from the throne of the castle, clutching her head.]

Luz: [grunts] How did I get here?

[Luz looks down and notices that she is wearing Belos' outfit. Shocked, she gasps, then yells out in fright and falls backwards, landing on the ground in a sitting position. She then looks up at the throne.]

Luz: What is this? Is- is this a dream?

[As Luz speaks, Stringbean appears from behind Luz and bites on her ear and squeaks. Luz cries out in pain.]'

Luz: Ow!

[Cut to a closer POV of Luz and Stringbean.]

Luz: Stringbean, it's you! You sweet, little power noodle. I'm so happy to see you. Are Mama and the others okay?

[As Luz speaks, Stringbean floats towards Luz's hands as she carries the palisman in her palms. Stringbean squeaks apologetically in response to Luz's question. Luz looks to her right worriedly.]

[Cut to Luz walking down the corridors of the castle. Eventually, she finds the front door and walks out of it. She walks up the bridge and looks around scaredly.]

Luz: Where is everyone?

[Luz walks over to the edge and looks down, then gasps in shock. Beneath the bridge, various residents of the Boiling Isles have been petrified, with an expression of shock and horror frozen on their faces.]

Luz: [horrified] No! No, no, no! Wh- When did this happen?

Amity: [resentfully] Don't you remember?

[Luz looks towards the source of sound, eyes wide and in surprise. Far away from her, Amity is standing on the platform on the other side that connects the bridge, holding her staff. She doesn't look at Luz, but her voice is filled with anger.]

Amity: This is all your doing. You helped Belos meet The Collector. [turns around to face Luz] Your actions led to THIS.

[Cut to Amity staring at Luz furiously, tears forming in her eyes.]

Amity: You've been the real villain this whole time!

[As Amity speaks, she raises her staff and points at Luz.]

Luz: Wha- [desperately] Listen, I- I don't know what I missed, but I'd never do this.

[Luz takes off her cloak and throws it aside.]

Luz: See?

[The cloak flies down the bridge and drops among the petrified statues. Cut to Amity looking to her left with a despaired look on her face, before shutting her eyes.]

Amity: I'm sorry, Luz. But I have to take you down.

[As Amity speaks, she draws a spell circle and summons some abomination goo, then rides on it and rushes forward towards Luz.]

Luz: Amity, please!

[Luz narrowly dodges Amity's abomination goo and runs away. Amity then draws another spell circle and launches the goo towards Luz. Stringbean immediately transforms into a staff, enabling Luz to escape on it and narrowly misses another attack from Amity. Luz flies past an angry Amity and into the castle. The doors slam shut, finally blocking the attacks from Amity.]

Luz: This isn't a dream. This is a nightmare!

[Cut to Eda with her eyes shut. Her eyes suddenly shot open as she gasps. She then sits up.]

Eda: Huh?

[Eda finds herself locked up in a cell. Cut to a POV outside the cell. A bright yellow flash emerges from inside the cell, then Harpy Eda kicks down the steel door. Cut to POV from the middle of the Conformatorium. Eda walks over to the edge of the walkway.]

Eda: Lilith? Hooty? [echoes] King!

[Eda looks around and finds no one nearby. Shen then flies through the hallway, barges through the front door, and flies towards the sky, frightened and panting.]

Eda: Huh?

[Eda looks up and sees a net coming towards her. The net captures Eda, causing her to drop to the ground, wrapped up in the net. She then sits up.]

Eda: If you think you can keep me from my family, you got another thing comin'!

[As Eda speaks, she looks up to the platform of the front door of the Conformatorium. Lilith and Gwendolyn can be seen standing on the platform.]

Lilith: [chuckles] Don't worry, Edalyn. We're all present and accounted for.

[As Lilith speaks, the scene changes to a closer look at Lilith and Gwendolyn. Scene then changes again to a POV from behind Gwendolyn and Lilith, showing the duo looking down at Eda.]

Eda: Lily! Ma! Thank goodness. Hey, help me out. We gotta find King.

Lilith: No. You'll be staying right there.

[As Lilith speaks, multiple shadowy figures walk out from the front door of the Conformatorium.]

Eda: Huh?

[Multiple coven scouts appear beside Eda and point their spears at her.]

Lilith: Dangerous beasts need to be kept in cages, after all.

Eda: [frightened] What are you talking about?

[Cut to Lilith and Gwendolyn staring down at Eda judgingly. They then turn around to look back at the door.]

Dell: Why, Eda?

[Dell walks out from the door with his right hand covering his right eye.]

Dell: I forgave you.

[Dell lowers his hand to show that his right eye is also now injured and blinded. Eda gasps at the sight of this.]

[Cut to King in a dark place with his eyes shut. His eyes shot open as he gasps. He then sits up, clutching his head. Two torches in front of him suddenly gets ignited, surprising King. The camera zooms out to show he is inside the room where the shrine of the Huntsman is located, back on Titan Trapper Island. Scene changes to show the skulls of the deceased Titans scattered around the room. King stands up, looking terrified. Bill suddenly emerges from behind him.]

Bill: Nice, right?

[King screams and runs away, then turns around to look at Bill.]

King: Bill! You crazy jerk, how'd I get here?

Bill: I brought you here! I wanted to show you our new collection.

[As Bill speaks, King turns his head and stares at the skulls in fright. Bill then walks down the stairs.]

Bill: What's wrong? Don't you recognize your siblings? [chuckles] But don't worry, we saved the best spot for you!

[King turns around. Scene changes to show the shrine. A door somewhere above opens, casting light into the shrine. King whimpers in fear as Bill grabs onto his arms.]

[Back at the Emperor's Castle, Luz flies through a corridor, then lands and runs down another corridor to her right. Suddenly, she finds herself in a surrounding similar to Willow's mindscape.]

Luz: Trees?

[Luz stops and pants. She notices something on her right and turns towards that direction. Not far away from her, Willow is kneeling in front of a tree.]

Luz: Willow!

[Luz runs towards Willow. Cut to a POV from in front of Willow, which shows her holding a seedling in her palms with a blank expression.]

Luz: Oh Willow, I'm so happy to see you. Do you know what's going on? I just saw Amity, and-

Willow: You know, Luz, my life changed after I met you. I finally believed that there was this big, bright future ahead of myself.

[As Willow speaks, she stands up and turns around to face Luz. Wind starts blowing around the same.]

Willow: [sighs] But that didn't last long, did it?

[The seedling in Willow's palms fade away as she speaks. She then looks up at Luz angrily, with green glowing eyes and tears flowing down her cheeks.]

Willow: [angrily] You destroyed my home and any chance I had at happiness. I have no future now. NONE OF US DO!

[As Willow speaks, she forms spell circles with her hands, then angrily summons vines from the ground to attack Luz. Luz screams and runs away. After a while, Luz slows down and turns around to look back, slowly backing off as she gasps and whimpers. Her surrounding turns dark. Suddenly, a light turns on. Luz turns around with her left eye shut, trying to see what's going on while adjusting herself to the brightness.]

Gus: Look, everyone. It's good ol' Luz.

[As Gus speaks, the scene zooms out to show Luz and Gus on the stage inside Hexside's gym. Gus is wearing his grom outfit and introducing Luz to the audience below. The audience cheers. Luz looks down at them with a puzzled expression. Gus steps in front of the camera.]

Gus: And she, just might be, the biggest hypocrite ever.

[Audience boos.]

Luz: Wh- what?

Gus: Everyone helped you get back to your mom. Meanwhile, because of you, I'll never see my dad again.

[As Gus speaks, he walks towards Luz, then turns around and stares at her angrily with teary eyes while walking towards her, forcing her to retreat.]

Luz: Gus, no. I- I- I swear, we'll get him back. [turns towards the audience] We'll get everyone back! I won't stop till we do.

[Gus approaches Luz from behind, giving her a death stare.]

Gus: Tell that to HIM!

[As Gus speaks, Luz turns around to face Gus, but he pushes her off the stage. Luz lands on the ground in a different surrounding. As she tries to get up, she groans as she clutches her head. She then looks to her left, and sees Hunter staring at a large Flapjack statue in the distance, with his back facing her. They are at the Emperor's Castle.]

Hunter: I've always just— followed orders. I never thought about making friends or— going to school. Then I met Flapjack. He was more than a palisman. He was my best friend. [angrily] And then I lost him, helping you! But you still get to have your own palisman?

[Hunter turns around to face Luz as he speaks, staring at Luz angrily and teary-eyed. He then drops to his knees.]

Hunter: [distraught] Why, Luz? Why do you get to have it all?

[Tears flow down Hunter's cheeks as he speaks. He then starts sobbing. Amity, Gus, and Willow then approach Hunter and stand around him. The trio stare at Luz accusingly.]

Amity: I'm sorry. But for the sake of everyone you hurt—

[Amity points her staff at Luz as she speaks.]

Luz: [pleadingly] Please. No.

[Tears flow down Luz's cheek as she speaks. She then shuts her eyes and turns her head away.]

Amity: —I challenge you to a witch's battle!

[Luz's eyes shot open in surprise. She turns her head and looks at Amity.]

Luz: [crying tone] Wait. Say that again.

Amity: I said, I challenge you to a witch's battle!

Luz: A- a witch's battle?

[Luz walks towards Amity as Stringbean changes into her palisman form.]

Luz: Bap. Boop.

[She squishes Amity's cheek and plays with her ears.]

Luz: You look like Amity.

[She lifts up Amity's arm and touches it.]

Luz: You feel like Amity.

[She holds Amity's left hand and looks at it suspiciously, then looks up at her.]

Luz: But you're not Amity, are you?

[Luz laughs and takes a few steps back.]

Luz: You're not her! None of you are you!

Willow: How dare you? Of course we're us!

Luz: It's "I challenge you to a witch's duel," not "witch's battle." And the Amity I know would never misquote The Good Witch Azura.

[Stringbean transforms into a staff for Luz to hold on to.]

Luz: [provokingly] So come on. Attack me. I know what's going on now. [smirks]

[Angered by Luz's words, Amity, Gus, and Willow proceed to rush forward and attack Luz. However, Amity's staff is being hold back by some pink strings before it can touch Luz. Luz opens her eyes, sees this, and takes a step back. In front of her, Amity, Gus, and Willow grunt as they are all held back by the pink strings. Suddenly, Amity opens her eyes, looks up at Luz in surprise and gasps. Light slowly returns to her dull and lifeless eyes. She squints her eyes slightly as a tear forms in her right eye.]

Amity: Luz?

[Luz puts a hand on Amity's cheek.]

Luz: Amity, is that you? Is it really you?

Amity: Yes! We've all been collected, including Camila. The Collector came from the sky, and-

Gus: He's playing games with you, Luz. He's trying to keep you away from King and Eda!

Willow: But if you want to save anyone, you have to wake up!

Luz: How?

Hunter: Think about it. What's the first thing you do when you wake up from a bad dream?

[As Hunter speaks, pink strings drop down from the sky and wrap around his arms. Hunter then looks up and smiles at Luz.]

[Amity releases her left hand from gripping her staff and places it on Luz's left hand.]

Amity: You turn on the light.

[Amity lets go of Luz's hand, leaving behind a paper with an glowing light glyph in her palm. Luz stares at the glyph, then looks up at Amity and smiles, a tear forming in her right eye. Gus, Amity, Hunter, and Willow all smile back at her. Amity has tears in her eyes. Suddenly, the strings transform the quartet into lifeless puppets again. The quartet is then dragged up into the sky and promptly disappears. Luz drops to her knees upon seeing this, and lowers her head, eyes shut. After taking a deep breath, she opens her eyes, then claps her hands together, activating the light glyph. The screen flashes yellow, then turns black.]

[Scene continues with a shot focused on Luz's face with her eyes shut. She slowly opens it, then cries out in fright. Camera zooms out to show her standing on a checkered pattern platform with large toys around her. Scene changes and shows Luz standing on a large Rubix cube, which is floating mid air in some sort of galaxy like dimension. There are other large toys floating nearby. A meteor shoots across the sky above Luz.]

[Luz walks ahead and looks at the surrounding in shock, accompanied by Stringbean. She then notices King on her left, who is still stuck in his own nightmare and whimpering in terror. Beside him, puppetified Tarak and Bill are being controlled by strings and used to terrorize King. King looks up, looking terrified. His eyes are glowing, just like Bill and Tarak. Luz then looks to her right and sees Eda getting terrorised by puppet Lilith, Dell, and Gwendolyn. All of their eyes are glowing too.]

Eda: I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it!

[Luz rushes forward and grabs Eda's arm, then places a light glyph in her hand and activates it. Eda looks at the light ball in her hand, which breaks her out from her nightmare and her eyes stop glowing.]

Eda: Huh?

[Puppet Lilith, Dell, and Gwendolyn stop moving and gets dragged up to the sky as Eda watches, before they all disappear in a puff of smoke. Luz then rushes over to King and places another light glyph in his palm and activates it. King opens his eyes and stares at the light ball, successfully breaking out from his nightmare. Puppet Tarak and Bill gets dragged into the sky as King watches. When he looks back down, he sees Luz kneeling right in front of him, causing him to gasp and jump back.]

King: Weh? Luz? LUZ!

[King happily pounces towards Luz while laughing and crying happy tears, causing her to fall backwards. ]

Luz: Hey, buddy! [chuckles]

[Behind the duo, Eda stands up and looks over at them.]

Eda: Is this— real? Is that Luz?

[Eda starts crying happy tears and exclaims in delight, running over to the duo.]

Eda: Are you both really here?

Luz: Get over here, you witch!

[As Luz speaks, she extends her hand. Eda rushes over and kneels down right next to Luz and King, hugging them both tight and squealing in pure happiness. She then kisses them both. Scene changes to show Luz, who is now also crying happily. Cut to a POV showing the trio hugging each other blissfully. Stringbean floats over and attaches herself onto Luz's face, smiling.]

[Cut to The Collector looking at this scene on the screen of a yellow star-shaped object angrily, with his back facing the camera. He then turns around.]

The Collector: [groans] I thought you said this would work, Rae-Rae. You said, it would make them all "see the error of their ways." But King is gonna hate me for this! Now what do we do?

[As The Collector speaks, he casts the star object away using magical powers, and yells at Belos angrily, before finally sitting down on the bed with his arms crossed.]

Belos-Raine: [sighs] Why bother teaching them anything when you could just— wipe them out?

[As Belos speaks, he grabs Francois and looks at it, but The Collector snatches it away from his hand.]

The Collector: I WANT to be their friends! And besides, my powers don't work on King.

[The Collector caresses Francois' head as they speak, before setting it on the table next to their bed.]

Belos-Raine: The—dog?

The Collector: Yeah! 'Cause he's a Titan!

[The Collector waves their hands as two illusions depicting a Titan's skull whooshes past above their head. Belos' eyes widen, then he appears to be deep in thought.]

The Collector: You worked in the castle, Rae-Rae. You've seen the big old heart, still beating too. Titans are AMAZING!

[Nearing the end of his sentence, The Collector floats up and lies back down on his bed, grinning. Scene changes to focus on "Raine's” face.]

The Collector: When they're full grown, they are more POWERFUL than anyone!

[An idea pops into Belos' mind.]

Belos-Raine: You know, I just had an interesting idea.

[Belos smiles and sits down on the bed next to The Collector.]

The Collector: Yeeeeeaaah?

Belos-Raine: [waves their hand] No, it wouldn't work.

The Collector: What? What wouldn't work? Tell me, or I'll hold my breath for a million years!

[The Collector floats up and then grabs onto Belos' face as he speaks. Belos chuckles and gently puts down The Collector's hands, holding them in his own hands.]

Belos-Raine: Well, if you insist. What if you played with those three yourself? Showed them just how much fun your games are in person? Then they'll ALL want to be your friend.

[The Collector smiles as their eyes light up upon hearing Belos' words.]

The Collector: You think?

Belos-Raine: [nods] Mm-hmm.

The Collector: [ecstatically] ALRIGHT!

[The Collector summons the yellow star from below and places it above his head. He then floats up towards it and waves at Belos.]

The Collector: Wish me luck, Rae-Rae!

[The Collector flies upwards and through the star, which then shrinks and disappears. Belos grunts, swipes Francois to the ground, and rummages through the drawer of the table beside The Collector's bed. Eventually, he takes out a blue star.]

Belos-Raine: [smiling evilly] Perhaps this will be easier than I thought.

[Nearing the end of sentence, the voice changes from Raine's voice to Belos' voice.]

Eda: Oh! I thought I'd never see you again! How did you get back to the Demon Realm?

Luz: It's a very long story, I wouldn't know where to begin. There was Belos in the Human Realm—

Eda and King: There was what?

Luz: Then, we saw Kikimora, she uh, was a lot to deal with—

King: I can imagine.

Luz: And then my mom decided to - WOAH, how did that happen?

[Luz points to Eda's missing arm, covered in a bandage.]

Eda: Ah, it's a shorter story. Oh! Is that your palisman?

[Stringbean sits on Luz's shoulder. Owlbert appears and the palismen greet each other.]

King: Hey, hey, all I wanna do is hear both of you talk over hot chocos milk, but first, we gotta find a way outta, whatever this is!

[A bright flash of light appears and a pink star manifests above the trio. The Collector comes through the star.]

The Collector: I don't get it, King. I really don't get it. I thought you loved playing our games. Why do you choose these itty bitty spiders over me?

Eda: Because your games stink, squirt!

[Eda steps forward and turns her arm into a claw.]

Luz: And spiders are awesome!

[Luz activates her staff and aims it at The Collector.]

King: Yeah! Especially the itty bitty ones!

The Collector: Ah, you act like I'm doing something bad. But I'm just having fun.

King: Trapping people and scaring them and controlling them? That's not fun, Collector.

Eda: And everyone nearly died from the Draining Spell!

The Collector: So? Toys break all the time, you just fix them.

[The Collector creates a doll of himself and splits it into two. The pieces fall to the ground and fix themselves.]

Luz: Do you... not understand what death means to mortals?

The Collector: Well, don't worry 'cause I don't wanna scare you anymore. I think we can all be great friends. So, let me show you some of my favorite games!

[The Collector levitates into the sky and starts to summon something.]

[Scene changes to Raine limping through the Archives. There is a trail of black goo that follows them. The Collector's spell vanishes and Raine gains control of their body.]

Raine: Ah, let me go!

Belos-Raine: Ugh, Raine's always been annoyingly powerful. [Pulls out the blue star from earlier] No, I think I'll keep you around a little longer.

[He flies on the star and goes off-screen. Scene changes to show the puppets of Amity, Willow, Gus, and Hunter. One of Amity's fingers starts to twitch.]

[Montage of Eda, Luz and King playing The Collector's game. First game is based on Pac-Man, where The Collector’s enlarged head chases the trio through a maze. The game ends when Stringbean stings The Collector's tongue after trying to eat Luz. Annoyed, he snaps his fingers and the game changes to Marbles, with the trio trapped inside them. When Eda and Luz are knocked out, King charges and makes The Collector fall by tripping on the marble. Next game is Jenga. Eda sends the blocks flying towards The Collector when the tower starts falling. He angrily gets up, but then his face saddens. The Collector snaps his fingers, causing the group to be transported back to their original location.]

King: Thank... whoever. I think I barfed, like, twelve times.

Eda: Wanna make it a lucky number thirteen?

[Eda smiles as she picks King up and throws him in the air. He lands back in her arms as she rocks him.]

King: Eda!

[The Collector is alone in a corner. Luz hears him crying and makes to go to him.]

Eda: Luz.

King: Eda, let her go. If anyone can talk some sense into them, it's Luz.

[Luz smiles at the two, walks to The Collector, then kneels next to him.]

Luz: Collector, you know this can't last forever.

[The Collector wipes his tears on his sleeve.]

The Collector: Why, 'cause you know you'd lose?

[Eda and King come behind Luz. The Collector's face saddens again.]

The Collector: I just wanted a friend who wouldn't lie to me, or trick me. But everyone's the same! King lied, Belos lied, even they lied.

Luz: Who's they?

The Collector: The Archivists, my siblings. "Oh, let's play a game", they said. [angrily clenches fists] "Let's play hide-and-seek."

[Luz, Eda, & King hear thunder rumbling in the sky.]

The Collector: [still recalling] "You go down there and see if the Titans wanna play!"

[Luz, Eda, & King look up to see an image of The Collector's story in the stars. The Archivists guide The Collector down to the Titans.]

The Collector: So I played, and it was great. [While he says this, the stars move to show The Collector playing with the young Titans.] The baby Titans were the cutest, just like King! [While he says this, the stars move to show the young Titans surrounding a joyful Collector.] And they were all so welcoming! But the Archivists were scared of their power, so one by one, they disappeared, until there was one Titan left. [While he says this, the stars move to show the hands of the Archivists seizing the young Titans and taking them offscreen to represent their killing of the Titans. The Collector, now alone, rotates, looking for the Titans. A large pair of eyes representing the last Titan appear behind The Collector.] And he thought I was the bad guy. [The stars move to show the last Titan holding The Collector, now imprisoned, and placing him away.] He hid his egg from me and trapped me. [In a flash of light, the flashback ends.]

The Collector: But I showed all of them. Even when those trapper jerks started acting weird. Even when Belos lied to me! I found King! I found the last Titan, and he's my friend now!

King: Collector—

The Collector: I know it's just pretend. I don't care. I'll pretend as long as I want.

[While The Collector says this, he angrily runs forward to Luz, sending a small breeze in her direction.]

Luz: But that's not what you want, is it?

The Collector: What do you know?

Eda: We know what it's like to feel alone.

King: And abandoned—

Luz: And misunderstood. Hey, what if we showed you how we became friends?

The Collector: King already told me about your adventures.

Luz: It's different when you can see them.

[Luz pulls out a stack of the memory pictures from the previous episode that showcase her, Eda and King's adventures.]

Luz: What do you think? Can we tell you our stories?

[Scene changes to outside the Emperor's castle. Belos-Raine is atop The Collector's shooting star. Outside the castle, the star crash-lands while Belos attempts to keep control of a resistant Raine.]

Raine: [enraged] I said, GET OUT!

[Raine inhales, then whistles. The vibrations from their bard magic repel Belos, sending him toward the castle. Unbeknownst to Raine, their sound waves also blasted their earring ahead of him.]

Belos: [reforms] That's fine. Only one vessel is big enough to do what I need.

[Belos advances toward the castle entrance.]

Raine: [watches] Huh?

[Raine realizes Belos' plan.]

Raine: No.

[Raine stands up and follows Belos, leaving behind their earring.]

[Raine runs inside the castle after Belos. They run up the stairs, hitting against the wall on their way before continuing onward. Raine finally makes their way to the door that opens to the main chamber containing the Titan's heart. They summon their instrument.]

Belos: You know what this is, don't you? It's the last of many, but it still beats.

[Raine scans around them, looking for Belos. Belos comes from within the ground and crawls up to their upper body. He expands.]

Belos: [seizing Raine's instrument] It's the Titan's heart!

[Belos bites Raine's arm, causing them to drop their instrument. They shout in pain.]

[Raine attempts to use their bard magic by whistling, but Belos engulfs them to prevent this. Belos then leaves behind his parts that are muting Raine and makes his way to the heart. He begins to climb up the wall to the heart. Raine manages to move their body close enough to grab their instrument. They slam it against the ground with enough force of sound waves to surround the room. Belos manages to make contact with the heart before the sound waves reach it completely. He expands.]

Belos: Poor Raine. You tried so hard, didn't you?

Raine: [gasps]

[Belos fully attaches to the heart, then unleashes mold-like branches from his chest beyond Raine. They spread through the castle. The Titan's right eye begins to glow blue.]

[Scene changes. The setting has changed to the Archive House, where the corridors glow green. A semi-conscious puppet Amity's hand etches a light glyph into the ground and activates it, releasing a ball of light that returns her to her active state.]

Amity: Oh my gosh. It worked!

[Amity looks around the room she and the others are in. She sees Cat, Amelia, and Lilith, all of whom have been Collected. She focuses on Lilith.]

Amity: [rubbing her left eye] Miss Lilith?

[Gus, Willow, and Hunter all awaken. Gus looks at more Collected figures and screams in horror.]

Gus: Where the heck are we?

Willow: These must be the Archives.

[Gus sees that Camila is still in her Collected form.]

Gus: Camila! Willow, help me get her down.

[While Gus says this, Amity is looking around the room, hoping to see Luz.]

[Gus and Willow both summon their Palismen and start making their way toward Camila. Hunter stands up.]

Amity: Guys, [Hunter, Gus, and Willow turn around to look at Amity.] where's Luz?

[The next scene opens with a shooting star flying past the Owl House and finally landing in front of it. The Collector then makes the star vanish. He is followed by Luz on Stringbean, and Harpy Eda with King.]

Luz: Wow, I thought we would just, like, flip through these.

The Collector: So it all started at the birdhouse.

Eda: The Owl House. Speaking of which, what happened to it?

[Eda flies up and views the current state of the Owl House.]

King: You, uh, haven't been here in a while.

[Luz looks at a picture of her at the Owl House. In the picture, she is sticking her tongue out and smiling. Eda is standing by the door, arms crossed and smiling. King is sitting on top of a smiling Hooty, waving to the camera.]

Luz: For me, it started in the Human Realm. Things were not great, but I found my way here, and I met Owlbert, Hooty, and Eda the Owl Lady.

[While Luz says the latter sentence, Eda flies back down to the ground and places her hand on Luz's back.]

King: [jumps into Luz's arms] And the King of Demons!

Luz: None of us felt like we fit in. So we decided to not fit in together.

The Collector: [crosses his arms, scoffs] It was that easy, huh?

Luz: Not really—

[Luz sets King down and shows The Collector a picture of Luz and those who deceived her in "Witches Before Wizards".]

Luz: I had a lot to learn. But after a little while, I met more people who helped me.

[While saying this, she flips through more pictures, which include Luz trying out to be a Hexside student in "The First Day", Willow and Gus supporting Luz in "Agony of a Witch", and Luz playing Grudgby with Willow and Amity against Boscha and her team in "Wing It Like Witches". A Grom photo can be seen behind it.]

The Collector: Whoa! That game looks fun. I wanna go there!

[They all fly to Hexside's Grudgby field. Luz, who is now holding Stringbean in her dormant form, and Eda who is carrying King, stand at the top while The Collector hovers above on his star.]

Luz: This is where we play a game called Grudgby.

King: The ball can bite you, the rules are nonsense, but it's still kinda fun.

Eda: Nonsense? Ha! Hexside lets you play any magic sport these days. Grudgby was all we had and we made the best of it.

[Luz places her right hand on top of Eda's hair. Eda grins.]

Luz: And you were the star player, we know, Eda.

[The screen focuses on The Collector.]

King: [from offscreen] Did you know Lilith was their captain?

Luz: [from offscreen] Really? Now that's a spinoff I'd watch.

[While Luz says this, The Collector's mouth closes, his facial expression becomes more serious. and he looks ahead of him. He sees, Jerbo, Matt Tholomule, and Moon girl, all hiding from him. The Collector uses his star to glide over to the trio.]

The Collector: [grinning] Hi, I'm The Collector. Wanna be my Grudgby buddies?

[While he says the second sentence, the screen slightly zooms in to his face and his eyes begin to glow.]

Matt: It's him! Run! Go, go, go, go, go! [screams and runs with the rest]

[As they run, Luz, Eda, and King make their way to The Collector.]

[The Collector is upset by this. His grin turns into a frown.]

The Collector: I wanna go somewhere different.

[Luz holds out her deck of photos. The Collector takes a photo of the Knee.]

[Cut to the Knee. Eda, still carrying King, Luz, and The Collector all make their way up to the top.]

Luz: I'm really glad you picked this place, Collector. It's really special to me. It's where Eda helped me make a connection with the Isles.

[Luz draws an ice glyph. She activates it, and it takes form into a small block of ice that raises from the glyph.]

The Collector: [scoffs] A baby could do that. Still, I've never seen an itty-bitty spider do it that way. Not everyone can recognize Titan magic.

[The Collector is now offscreen. Luz, Eda, and King all look at each other while The Collector continues talking.]

The Collector: He must really like you if he showed you this much. [cut back to The Collector] He never told me about it, though.

[The Collector puts his left pointer finger above the snow, and creates a snow sculpture of a Titan.]

The Collector: Did you force him to be your friend, too? Like, uh, what are their names— Lilith and Amity?

King: She didn't force anyone to do anything.

Luz: Yeah, people are complex. And sometimes they just need a little kindness and forgiveness.

[The Collector looks down at the ice Luz made and then looks back at Luz, Eda, and King.]

The Collector: Kindness and forgiveness, huh?

[Luz and Eda smile at The Collector. Suddenly, there is heavy breathing in the distance that draws all of their attention.]

The Collector: [begins walking toward the edge of the Knee] Do you hear that?

Luz: Hear what?

[The breathing continues louder. Trees shake, birds flee, water begins to recede, and rubble falls from landforms.]

The Collector: [his eyes widen] Breathing.

[Belos' glowing eye shines and continues to glow.]

The Collector: Those eyes—don't tell me it's—

Luz: Belos.

[The scene changes. In the alleyway of Bonesborough, a rat runs through a large crack. Tinella Nosa appears to be thrown out of that crack. Seeing the dangerous branches spreading throughout the alley, she screams and runs away as they follow her. On a railway in one of the Knee's tunnels, three Coven Scouts are sitting around a fire. They are interrupted by the branches of mold that sends them fleeing. As Luz, Eda, King, Stringbean, and The Collector fly above, they see the branches violently spreading throughout the Boiling Isles.]

Luz: It's coming from the castle. [flies downward]

[Belos has now taken on a massive, monstrous form. His eyes continue to glow blue, and he now has wings.]

Belos: [growls] Finally! I can cleanse this perdition... MYSELF!

[Three times, Belos unleashes blue fire upon the land. Luz, Eda, King, Stringbean, and The Collector arrive at the scene.]

Eda: Is that Belos?

Luz: How'd he get here without a body?

[The Collector steps on Raine's earring. He picks it up, visibly worried.]

King: What do we do? There's no way we can stop that!

The Collector: Yes, there is. [begins glowing] And I know how. [The Collector flies through the air, cutting away at the moss. He stops short of Belos's face.]

Luz: No, what is he doing?

The Collector: I get it now. You just need kindness and forgiveness, huh?

[The Collector hugs Belos's skull. Luz, Eda, and King have stunned expressions on their faces, Belos blinks in confusion.]

The Collector: Luz, look! We can all be buddies now!

[Belos prepares to fire at The Collector, Eda, King, and Luz watch in horror.]

Luz: Collector! [She flies on her staff.]

King: No!

[As Belos fires, the beam heavily collides with a purple flash of light. Luz has flown in to save The Collector.]

The Collector: Huh? But I thought I was doing the right thing.

Luz: No, no, you did good, Collector. But this is a little more complicated. Don't worry, I think it... missed... me.

[As she says this, Luz realizes that the branches have already hit her fingers and they slowly take over her body. Luz groans as it reaches her shoulder and her hat floats down. Stringbean changes to her active form. Luz slowly becomes particles of light.]

The Collector: Luz? What's happening?

Luz: Eda, King, looks like we're gonna be split up again. I feel like I should be used to this feeling by now, but... I still don't know what to say.

[As Luz says this, Eda and King have terrified expressions on their faces.]

[Luz's entire body is covered by the moss and she splits into several balls of light. The Collector holds on to her hand and catches one of the light orbs, holding it tightly. Luz's palisman reverts to staff form and falls to the ground.]

The Collector: Where'd she go?

[Eda and King are too stunned to speak. The light orbs flow through the damaged areas. They travel by Hexside, where the students are terrified of the moss. They finally reach the Archive House, where Gus, Willow, Hunter, and Amity observe, confused.]

Amity: What is this?

[Camilla's puppet begins crying]

The Collector: Luz? Luz? Yoo-hoo! You can come out now. Well, it's okay, she just broke, so I'll fix her. [He snaps his fingers, but the spell dissipates.] What? Why isn't it working? The Archivists aren't here, they couldn't have taken her.

[Belos aims another beam at The Collector. King suddenly roars and defends The Collector, conjuring a round shield with glyph patterns on it. His eyes have become purple and extra fangs have appeared in his jaw. A blue light glows in his mouth and tears flow down his face as he roars again.]

The Collector: Owl Lady, you know where Luz is, right?

Eda: Back up, kid. I don't think I can control myself right now.

[Eda roars and grows in size and reverts to her original Owl Beast form. Her eyes have become orange and has extra sets of wings. Roaring again, she joins King and they attack Belos. King releases his power and they avoid the blasts. Terrified, The Collector trips, causing him to let go of the light glyph.]

The Collector: She's really gone.

[A light orb floats into the In-Between Realm and settles into the water. From it, Luz's body reappears and she sinks into the water.]

Luz: [thinking] Oh. I know what I should have said... I should have thanked them.

[A hand grabs her arm and pulls her out before she goes any further. She sees a Titan in front of her.]

Luz: King?

Papa Titan: [chuckles] No. But he does get his good looks from me.

Luz: [shocked] Oh, Titan.

Papa Titan: Oh, me. Nice to meet you, Luz the Human.

Luz: You can't actually be the Titan Titan, right? You're the Boiling Isles, and that Titan is all -

Papa Titan: Dead-looking?

Luz: Does that mean I'm also—

Papa Titan: Ah, no, nope, no. Don't wanna do that. If you go under without a portal, you really will be dead-looking.

Luz: I can't believe this. You're King's dad!

Papa Titan: I think King said it best once. "I am both King and Queen, best of both things." [chuckles] But Dad works fine.

Luz: What is this place?

Papa Titan: This is the space in between. Well, in between a lot of places. And I've been stuck here for quite some time. But at least I can keep an eye on my child. And those who have been kind to him.

[Shows through a floating block moments of Luz and King spending time together.]

Luz: I'm not so kind. When I saw The Collector fly up to Belos, I hoped with all my heart I would see them blast him away, and— [sighs]

Papa Titan: Hey, I can relate. I was willing to do anything to keep my kid safe. But I attacked the wrong person. Dragged The Collector down here for nothing.

Luz: Does that make us as bad as Belos?

Papa Titan: What? Have you been drinking Eda's homemade Apple Blood?

Luz: Well, Belos says he's trying to save humanity. And we are saying we want to save our families. So isn't that the same thing? Don't—Don't these feelings come from the same place?

Papa Titan: You assume Belos's goal comes from a genuine place. But that man doesn't care about about anything but his need to be the hero in his own delusion. And because of that, he fears what he can't control.

Luz: And now that fear is going to win.

Papa Titan: Ah, dang.

[Luz gasps as she sees Papa Titan’s chest being affected by Belos’ possession.]

Papa Titan: I thought I had more time left. But Belos will have full control soon. You ready to stop him?

Luz: What? What can I do?

Papa Titan: You've already helped King so much. So let me use my last bit of life to help you.

[The Titan extends his hand. On it, various glyphs appear.]

Luz: Are you sure you wanna give this power to me?

Papa Titan: Well, you're the one here, and you seem like a good witch. But I can't give you anything unless you choose to accept it. So the question is, will you choose yourself?

[Luz takes his hand and a golden orb surrounds Luz. She starts to float up.]

Papa Titan: Now, Belos will be able to control everything, so you have to defeat him fast.

Luz: But-

Papa Titan: My power won't last forever, so use your time wisely.

Luz: Oh, but what about -

Papa Titan: Eda the Owl Lady? [salutes] Send her my regards, big fan.

[Luz reaches out and holds on to Papa Titan's claw to keep from being sent further upward.]

Luz: No, King, what about King? Don't you wanna say something to him?

[Papa Titan thinks for a moment, then whispers something in Luz's ear. Luz is excited by what she hears.]

Luz: Oh. He'll love that. [chuckles]

[Papa Titan takes on his larger form and starts to sink into the water. His body slowly sinks until it finally disappears into the water.]

Papa Titan: Goodbye, Luz.

[The next scene begins in the Collection Room in the Archive House. Camila begins to wake when Gus holds a light spell above her. Gus deactivates the light spell.]

Gus: [gasps] She's waking up!

[The others look at Camila. Gus helps her to get to sitting position as she repositions her glasses.]

Camila: Wha—what's happening? Where's Luz?

[Hunter's, Willow's, Amity's, and Gus' facial expressions all drop as she asks this.]

Gus: Uh—

[Camila is now nervous. Meanwhile, everyone hears rumbling not far from them, and they all look to see the walls and ceiling begin to collapse. Amity tries to create a shield with abomination matter, but it does not take form and falls on top of her.]

Amity: [confused] What's wrong with my magic?

[Camila stands up and walks to Amity.]

Camila: Can't you tell? You're exhausted. You all are! None of you have gotten rest in days.

Willow: But what can we do? We can't leave everyone like this.

Hunter: And what about Luz?

[Amity's face saddens.]

Camila: Luz is a Noceda. You know what that means? It means she's way too stubborn to let any of this get her down.

[While saying this, Camila puts her arm around Amity. Amity blushes at the mention of Luz. Willow, Gus and Hunter look at each other and smile, knowing Camila is right.]

[Camila walks forward, looking up at the Collected figures, and sighs.]

Camila: She'll be okay.

[Tears have welled up in Camila's eyes.]

Camila: In the meantime, [she wipes away her tears and prepares a notepad and pencil] I think I know how we can help, even without your magic.

[Scene changes to Eda and King fighting Belos's monster form. They are still in a state of rage. As Eda and King fight, and Belos fires, The Collector hides. The chaos sends Luz's staff flying near The Collector. He attempts to deescalate the battle.]

The Collector: No, please stop! Run away! [Snaps his fingers, but nothing happens.] Why isn't anything working?

[He sees the moss growing onto his hands.]

The Collector: I don't want anyone else to go away. I don't want anyone else to go missing! I'm sorry for everything!

[The Collector starts crying and feels his face, noticing the tears.]

The Collector: [tearfully]What is this stuff? Wh-why won't it stop? [He sees the moss growing onto Eda's claws. He desperately brushes it off.] No! No, no, no, no! Get off of her!

[The Collector gets scared when Belos prepares to crush them with his hand. He brings his hand down, but a beam of purple light deflects it. When the light clears, there is a gaping hole in Belos's hand. A light glyph shines through. A figure can be seen with an appearance similar to a Titan. The fog clears to reveal that it is Luz. While this happens, Stringbean becomes active and makes her way toward her owner. Eda, King, and The Collector are all in shock. Eda and King have slightly reverted.]

The Collector: Huh? It can't be—

Luz: I'm back!

[Eda, King and The Collector all stare at her in awe and shock.]

Luz: I - wait - Uh. Couldn't keep me away from - Hang on. Ugh! I still can't think of anything to say!

Eda: [squeals and reverts to Harpy form as King hugs her happily] It's Luz, all right!

[Belos roars in fury. This causes everything to shake, including the Archives. Luz creates a glowing orb around her, King, Eda, and The Collector. It shoots up suddenly and goes in a series of erratic motions. The crew can be heard screaming inside. It finally stops and everyone is shaken.]

Luz: Woah! [laughs] Overshot it a little. Still getting used to these powers. [Eda glares at her, unimpressed.]

[Belos roars and the Archives shake precariously.]

Eda: Oh no, everyone's still in the Archives.

The Collector: Leave them to me. [He jumps onto his blue star and flies off. He notices that the mold is progressively getting worse.] Come on, you can at least do this.

[Eda, Luz, and King travel to the stage below the Archives. The mold approaches quickly and takes forms of monstrous faces. Luz starts a spell, but struggles to make it. Eda holds Luz's hand and guides her.]

Eda: Concentrate, think of what you want and—

[The spell manifests into a large shield. The moss bounces off of it and curls upward. Luz and Eda push it forward and it eradicates the moss. Red grass takes over and shines in the arena.]

Luz: [chuckles] Yes!

[The moss appears on multiple sides.]

King: Luz! On three! One—

Luz: Two!

King and Luz: [in unison] Weh!

[They are able to get rid of most of the moss. The rest of it starts to engulf the roof of the arena. Luz and King rub their faces together, smiling.]

Luz: Eda!

[Luz flies upwards on Stringbean with King in tow and indicates for Eda to follow her. Luz extends her staff and Eda grabs her free hand. They spin in a circle and create a giant light spell that clears the entire area. They notice a looming shadow and realize the left arm of The Titan is rising.]

Luz: Hold on.

[Luz flies up in the sphere.]

[Scene changes to the Archives. Amity rescues Cat using a plant glyph as a giant rock falls above her, which Willow destroys with a fire glyph. Amity and Willow smile at each other. Camila continuously draws various glyphs and hands some off to Hunter. Gus is seen on his staff holding Amelia over his shoulder before a stray rock hits him and he falls. Gus uses a safety spell to gently fall and Hunter saves Gus's palisman by using an ice glyph. Hunter carries Amelia away as Gus flies off with more glyphs in hand. Everything violently shakes again, causing the castle to lose its support at The Titan's horn. They panic as they plummet, but pink strings manifest and hold it up. The Collector is seen straining to hold the structure up. The gang stares in shock as he smiles down on them.]

Hunter: The Collector?

Willow: Is he—?

Gus: He's helping!

[Scene changes back to the fight against Belos. Still in their glowing sphere, Luz, Eda, King, and Stringbean make it to the top.]

Luz: Hah! [She, King and Eda look at the full form in awe] Wow.

[Luz notices The Titan's power beginning to fade. She looks at the glowing orb coming from the skeleton.]

Luz: We have to cut Belos off from The Titan's power.

Eda: What are you thinking?

Luz: [chuckles] Come on Eda, you know where magic comes from.

Luz, King, and Eda: [in unison] From the heart!

[The sphere rockets down and lands forcefully near The Titan's heart. Belos screams in agony as he feels this.]

[Scene changes to Raine Whispers caught in the moss. They are whistling their version of Raine's Rhapsody in order to halt the moss's growth. Their glasses have fallen off, and a beam of purple light can be seen on the glass reflection. Raine becomes wary.]

Raine: Who's there? Stay away! [They struggle in the moss's hold. A hand puts their glasses back on.]

Eda: It's okay Raine, I got ya. [She pulls Raine out of the moss and hugs them.]

Raine: I am— still not used to this new look, but it doesn't matter. [Eda kisses Raine while they're talking and embraces them] I'm just happy you're here. [Notices Luz and gasps in surprise.] Luz? You look— fluffier? How long was I out for?

[Luz again notices The Titan's power starting to fade.]

Luz: We don't have much time. Let's end this.

Raine: Finally.

[They clear a path to the throne room in the castle. They see Belos's form in the heart and prepare for an onslaught. Luz launches spells that destroy the upcoming branches of mold, then summons a set of ice stairs and climbs to the heart. She grabs onto Belos's ribcage and starts pulling.]

Belos: You can't defeat me!

[A large number of hands manifest and attempt to hurt Luz. Eda slices them up with her harpy magic. Raine whistles at the moss and causes it to retreat. King releases his powers and helps to protect Luz.]

Luz: Do not underestimate me, Belos. For I am the Good Witch Luz, Child of the Human Realm, Student of the Demon Realm, and Warrior of Peace!

[Luz's eyes glow orange and various glyphs manifest around her hands. The Titan yells in agony and everything shakes again. The Collector struggles to hold up the Archives. Eda, Raine, and King continuously attack. Scene changes back to Luz]

Luz: [enraged] NOW EAT THIS, SUCKER!

[Luz successfully tears Belos out of the heart and everything falls silent as her screams echo into the silence. A manifestation of her hair being like Azura's, but pink, is shown.]

[The monster Belos outside the heart screams in agony as its heart emits a flash of purple and black lights and it explodes. The Titan's hand is stabilized as a rush of energy runs through it. The Titan's eyes lose color and turn off. Back to the castle, the monster turns to stone and eventually turns into dust and is blown away, along with the mold, thus restoring the red grass across the isles. The Archives building is slowly lowered down to The Titan's head The pink strings disappear as a tired Collector flies to where Camila and the others are. The blue star disappears as the moss around his hands slowly begin to fade away. Amity steps closer as The Collector recoils in fear. Amity then offers her hand out to him. He takes it, and small tears form in his eyes. They all rush to the balcony as they stare in awe as the moss slowly clears up. At Hexside, the mold at the front door starts to fade. Skara slowly opens the door as she and Matt stare in shock. After fully opening the door, they and a few other students observe their surroundings and slowly smile at the sight. Back at the castle, the mold also starts to clear up one by one. Raine, Eda and King burst out of the moss. King gasps for air as Raine and Eda look at each other as she smiles. Luz is then shown looking off into the distance, with the moon looming far from them. In front of her are the small remnants of Belos' goo form, which slowly turns into Philip.]

Philip: Luz— Luz, I'm- I'm free. Thank goodness you saved me from- [he pauses his speech as he sweats nervously] From that horrible curse.

[Luz does nothing but glare at him angrily. Her long hair and dress slowly bounce off and back into the wind.]

Philip: Yes, I-I was cursed with a terrible, terrible sickness, by— by dark magic, just like your mentor.

[As he speaks, the sky slowly turns dark, signaling the fall of boiling rain.]

Philip: It forced me to do all those [points offscreen] horrible things, but-but now, I'm free.

[A drop of boiling rain falls and he screams in pain, the part that the rain touched on his hand becoming green. Boiling rain starts to fall from the sky.]

Philip: AH! Qui-Quickly, now!

[He slowly crawls towards Luz, his face begging for help.]

Philip: Don't- Don't you want- to make peace - Luz?

[He slowly reverts back to his goo form due to the boiling rain. Luz's expression remains unfazed, the rain turning to sparkles on her hair as the boiling rain does not affect her.]

Philip: [partially back to goo form] Don't just stand there! [his body decomposes as he is fully back to goo form and starts to crawl back to Luz] You'll be just as bad, just as conniving, just as evil, and just as unforgivable as those witches!

[He holds Luz's leg in an attempt to convince her.]

Belos: We're human. We're better than this!

[Luz finally steps back as the camera shows her with a blank expression on her face. A scowling Raine, King and Eda step in front of her as they handle Belos, the trio under the protection of a magical leaf Raine had conjured.]

Eda: Well, we ain't!

[They press their faces nearer, their expressions becoming angrier.]

[Belos, now reduced to merely his skull, stares in shock. The trio raise their feet, and they cover the camera as they stomp on Belos repeatedly, bringing him to his end. The weather now clears.]

Raine: That was extremely satisfying.

King: Ew, it's on my claws!

[Raine feels the sun outside and they shut down their leaf. A glowing light comes from behind them as Luz glows and floats, her power from The Titan finally released. The energy manifests into the form of The Titan. Raine, King and Eda stare in shock.]

Raine: Is that—

Eda: [smiles] I think it is. [to King] Dang kid, you do have tall genes.

[King's eyes sparkle in wonder as the manifestation of King's father flies away. The scene slowly pans to Luz, who has returned to her normal Azura costume. Luz opens her eyes, but realizing she doesn't have powers anymore, she falls and screams. Eda and King run up to her and catch her as the three lay on the ground, side by side, panting. The clouds slowly start to reveal the sun shining as the three look on, their faces steady. Just then, Luz remembers something.]

Luz: Oh! Your dad had a message for you. [whispers to King]

King: I— loaf you? I loaf you... [chuckles] Bread pun!

[The trio laughs.]

Luz: Isn't it amazing? We did it. After everything, after all that— we stuck together.

[Eda and King look at her, satisfied.]

Eda: Yup, we did alright.

King: I'll say.

[The trio relaxes as they calm down, happy the war is over. Scene cuts to an overshot view of the ruined castle, which then cuts to a view of the sun shining between the clouds. Back to the Archives, Camila, Gus, Amity, Hunter, Willow and The Collector all stare into the surroundings with a warm feeling. Scene then cuts to a horizontal view of The Titan, with the Archives resting on the top of its head.]

Luz: [narrating] And that's how we saved the Boiling Isles.

[Scene cuts to views of places in Bonesborough. Scene then cuts to the forest, where the red pine trees are shown to be placed horizontally. A bird perches on one of the trees horizontally.]

Luz: [narrating] Well, as much as we could.

[Cut to the Archives, where everyone starts to come out safely.]

Luz: [narrating] We were so relieved to see everyone safely released from the Archives. They were spared the worst of it, at least.

[Cut to inside the Archives, where Lilith hands over a puppet Steve to be returned to normal by The Collector. Steve then feels his body and sees Lilith, who offers him a hug. Instead, Steve scoops her into a big hug, much to Lilith and The Collector's happiness. Zoom out to a shot of everyone reuniting with their families and loved ones.]

Luz: [narrating] Because of that, everyone got to reunite with their families and loved ones.

[Amity runs over to hug her father, who happily hugs her.]

Amity: Dad! [laughs happily]

[A person in front walks off to reveal Odalia scowling on the side. Cut to Gus, who looks around for his father worriedly. When he does, he releases several illusions of himself, which all approach his father. Once surrounded, Perry tries to hug the first 2 illusions until he gets to the third one, who turns out to be the real Gus. He picks him up and hugs him as the other illusions disappear. Willow looks around for her fathers, accompanied by Hunter. He then suddenly smiles and points to someone. Willow stares in shock and runs to hug her fathers, who then embrace and kiss. In the background, Hunter's expression turns gloomy as he realizes that no one is waiting for him.]

Luz: [narrating] And if someone thought they had no one waiting for them, well, they were in for a nice surprise.

[Someone suddenly ruffles Hunter's hair, and he looks towards them in annoyance to reveal Darius and Eberwolf, with an appreciative look on both of their faces. Darius then suddenly points to Hunter's shirt to which Hunter goes into detail explaining everything while Darius and Eberwolf look on, interested.]

[Back in Hexside, everyone celebrates the return of Principal Bump, which is met with applause. His long black hair, which is flowing in the wind, stops to reveal Amelia and Cat, who wave happily. Boscha suddenly pushes through the Blight twins (who were in front of her, Edric falling due to his cast), runs over, and hugs them, crying, with everyone celebrating.]

Luz: [narrating] Still, there was a lot of work to be done—

[Various citizens of Bonesborough, including Morton, observe all the damage done. Darius and Eberwolf, inside the ruined castle, look on at The Titan's hand, now in its new position.]

Luz: [narrating] And not everyone was keen to change things—

[Cut to Belos's ruined throne. Vitimir, Terra and Adrian all walk towards it with mischievous looks on their faces. Two big shadows suddenly loom over them, revealed to be Darius and Eberwolf. Darius forms his left hand into an abomination fist, seemingly threatening them. Eberwolf gives them the "I'm watching you" stare, pointing his fingers at his eyes and then at them, as the three Coven Heads walk away nervously. Vitimir suddenly returns to touch the edge of the throne and it is promptly smashed away by Darius's abomination hand.]

[Cut to Latissa, where coven scouts attempt to unsuccessfully move a tree. Yellow energy then surrounds it, and it slowly lifts to reveal the BATs and Steve using their magic to lift it as the coven scouts step back in shock. Steve then looks at the scouts with a firm expression on his face. They all take off their masks to reveal their true faces. The tree is then set down as Steve shakes hands with one of the scouts.]

Luz: [narrating] But we were ready to give it a shot. All of us.

[Inside the Owl House, Eda fixes the nest as she lays Raine down, then resting by their side. King jumps from behind, plopping into the spot beside Raine as Luz and Eda laugh. A blue light suddenly flashes offscreen and the gang turns to look at it. Cut to the door, where The Collector appears and goes inside the house, followed by a hooded Lilith. The sisters reunite and hug as Camila and Amity also enter the house. Amity runs to hug Luz, they subsequently share a kiss. Camila then nudges Luz's hand as the two then share a hug. Camila then looks behind her to see Eda and King holding out their hands with nervous expressions on their faces. Camila grabs Eda's hand and she and King are pulled into a hug with Luz. Lilith smiles at this as The Collector approaches her. He then summons a puppet Hooty and his birdhouse and Lilith touches it. In a puff of smoke, Hooty is returned to normal as he and Lilith share a happy reunion, Hooty wrapping Lilith in a tight ball as Raine laughs at the sight. Camila and Amity watch this with concerned looks as Luz pulls them both into a hug.]

Luz: [narrating] As for The Collector—

[The Collector then approaches King and decides to give him back Francois. King happily hugs Francois as he walks away.]

Luz: [narrating] —he and I made a pinky promise to keep trying our best. He said he had a lot of growing up to do, so he decided to return to the stars.

[King then catches up with The Collector and decides to let him have Francois. He then whispers in The Collector's ear, which makes him tear up.]

Luz: [narrating] No one argued, but I think I heard King whisper, "I hope I see you again."

[Scene then slowly pans around the room. Luz observes this then steps outside.]

Luz: [narrating] We got our happy ending, but I realized something in that moment.

[She takes a deep breath then observes the light glyph in her hands, then tapping it with no result.]

Luz: [narrating] When the Titan had finally passed on, so did the powers of the glyphs.

[Tears start to form in Luz's eyes.]

Luz: [narrating] I had learned the Titan's language, but now I had no one to speak it to. It had helped me find my place when I had no other way. In my heart, [she lets the wind carry it away] I'll never forget it.

[Stringbean comes into view, carrying Luz's hat in her mouth.]

Luz: [narrating] A whole chapter of my life was over—

[She happily accepts it as Stringbean wraps herself around Luz's neck. Luz then wears the hat as Stringbean turns into staff form and looks over the horizon.]

Luz: [narrating] —but a new one was just beginning.

[Four years later. Scene changes to show a statue of The Good Witch Azura in Luz's room in the human realm. Luz picks it up and places it in a box with other memorabilia. Luz picks up the box and puts it down into the table as her memo board comes into view; it shows that she has graduated from high school and won a writing scholarship. There are also pictures of Luz with her friends partaking on other new adventures. A slightly older Camila comes into the room.]

Camila: ¡Ahí estás tu! ¿Puedes ayudarme a envolver a estos maduros? (There you are! Can you help me wrap these maduros?)

Luz: I'll—be right there.

Camila: [sighs] I can't believe you're already leaving for college. Remind me, what major did you pick again?

Luz: C'mon mama, you know me. I picked all of 'em!

[Zoom out to show a now teenage Luz, proudly showing her mother all the list of courses at the University of Wild Magic.]

Camila: [walks closer to Luz] All of 'em? How is that even possible without your glyphs?

Luz: It's been tough, but me and Stringbean [pets Stringbean wrapped around her neck] figured out our own way of doing things. And, it'll be nice to finally see everyone again, after all this time.

Camila: Luz— [smirks] you saw them last week.

Luz: [chuckles] That doesn't count, I was studying for finals.

[The scene shows an older Vee and Owlbert waiting outside of Luz's room.]

Vee: It's time. Go get the others.

[Owlbert flies off to the door in the Human Realm. It has been remodified to look like The Collector's Archives. Owlbert lands on the doorknob and activates the portal.]

The Collector: [off-screen] Welcome to the Boiling Isles! Watch your step.

[The end credits roll. Owlbert flies next to Willow, who is now a professional flyer derby player. Together, they dive into the forest, where Hunter is carving a palisman from palistrom wood to give to Braxas. Willow lands on the ground and surfs on thorny vines. Hunter turns and he has a bluejay on his shoulder. He glances at the Bat Queen and Eda's parents working in the garden. He catches up with Willow and the walk before sliding down a steep incline. Hunter loses his balance and Willow breaks Hunter's fall, and they are in shock. They look to the side and they warmly smile. It is a gravestone for Flapjack, and Willow conjures delicate vines to decorate the gravestone. Hunter and Willow fly off to Bonesborough, where other characters are hanging out. They stop at the library, which is in the process of renovation. Mattholomule is seen overseeing the construction, while Kikimora is struggling with wooden beams. Lilith unfurls her plans for a library wing, and Hooty eagerly watches. The wind suddenly picks up and an Abomination themed blimp lands in front of them. Amity steps out and hugs Lilith. Lilith then reveals her new Harpy form, which resembles a raven. At Hexside, Skara can been seen playing the harp to young children, Barcus assists a kid with his plant magic, a new principal is hired and Bump has retired to gardening. Scene cuts to show Alador with a metallic glove on his hand. Raine, Jerbo, Darius and Eberwolf are observing the machine. Alador places the glove on a student's coven mark, and several Healing Track students, including Emira and Viney, send their magic through a thick wire. After several seconds they stop and the glove emits a puff of smoke. The student's mark is gone. Darius is excited and shakes Alador, making him embarrassed. Raine is called to the courtyard and flies with everyone else. The wild creatures that Luz has encountered are seen enjoying time with their young ones. It pans over to show a blue cloudlike structure. Scene zooms in to reveal it is the University of Wild Magic as Raine and Lilith land. Owlbert flies through the academy as various activities are shown: Edric is seen entertaining a bunch of students, the Illusion master is teaching about the Looking-Glass ruins, and Gus is doing a Human-Witch exchange program. The Headmaster's door comes into view and Eda excitedly comes out. She has a hook for a hand and performs a staff trick with the other. Raine and Lilith happily wave at her as she rides down on her staff. Back at the Owl House, where the portal door is now connected to, an older King is guiding people around, with one holding streamers. The door opens on the other side—]

Vee: Hurry, hurry! [phases through the portal and morphs into her basilisk form]

Luz: What's the rush Vee? No one's gonna be mad if we're a little late. [she and Camila enter, Luz covering her eyes with her hand as Camila guides her other hand]

Camila: Yes, but today is special.

Luz: Okay, okay.

[She opens her eyes and gasps.]

Everyone: SURPRISE!

[It is revealed all of her friends and family have thrown a Quinceañera (with a large sign hung labeled "King-ceanera") for Luz. Everyone applauds as Amity runs up to her and hugs her.]

Luz: [shocked] What is this? [Amity kisses her on the cheek.]

Eda: Well, since you spent your fifteenth birthday helping us rebuild the Isles—

King: —And sixteenth, and seventeenth.

Amity: We wanted to make it up to you.

Willow: Camila told us all about your quinceañeras from the Human Realm.

Gus: And they sounded a lot less haunted than our birthdays.

Lilith: [unrolls a scroll] Nevertheless, I made sure we followed Camila's instructions perfectly!

Camila: I- um-

[Hooty has made a structure with a Snaggleback hanging downwards. It is titled "Pain-yata." The Bat Children come by holding a purple dress made of spider webs. The Echo Mouse sews on some fingers a jewel and shows off their handiwork. Steve cuts a slice from a Good WItch Azura themed dress cake, and hundreds of small spiders pour out, which engulf his face as he smiles widely. Camila is visibly concerned.]

Camila: Great work everyone. [thumbs up] Muy bueno.

King: And look, look!

[He starts drawing a circular symbol on the ground, then taps it, revealing it is a light glyph as a small light spell manifests. Luz gasps as she holds it in her hand.]

Eda: King's powers are getting stronger. Yeah, and it looks like they're different from his dad's. But hey, you've got a whole new glyph language to try out.

Luz: [smiles] Guys—

King: We've got another surprise. The Collector was in the area and well, he wanted to do something special for the occasion. Look!

[The Collector's magic manifests in the sky. A blue star flies through the air, sending pink magic in different directions. Everyone looks in admiration.]

Luz: Eda, King, thank you. [smiles at them] For everything.

Eda: Right back at ya, kiddo.

Luz: [offers her hand] Weirdos?

Eda and King: Weirdos. [the two take it as Luz tearfully smiles]

Luz: [gasps] They're nearly gone. [rushes forwards and faces towards everyone] Okay everyone, on the count of three. One, two, three!

[Zoom out to all the characters as they wave at the camera.]

Everyone: Bye—eee!

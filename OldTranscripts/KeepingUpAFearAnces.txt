Young Eda: [Narrating.] It always starts the same way.

[A young Eda suddenly gasps and sits up, panting.]

Young Eda: [Narrating.] I wake up someplace dark.

[Eda finds herself in a shadowy void. She stands up and looks around with a frightened expression. A shadow flashes past behind her. She turns around to look at it.]

Young Eda: [Narrating.] And then it appears.

[The Owl Beast appears. It steps on the ground, causing it to shake. It then stretches its neck towards Eda, stops in front of her, and screeches. Eda cries out in surprise, then turns around and runs away, panting and crying. The scene then transitions into her in her room. She is sitting on her bed, telling this to a healer from the Healing Coven and her mother.]

Young Eda: And eventually... I wake up and I know I turned into... that thing.

Healer: I see. Here, take this. [Hands over a large gem to Eda.] It will tell you when the beast's energy is bubbling to the surface. Also, I hear gems are quite fashionable for young witches.

Gwendolyn: Oh, what a beautiful little stone. [To the healer.] May I speak with you outside? [Ushers him outside.] Just a minute, hon.

[Eda's mom closes the door. Outside the room, she starts scolding the healer. Eda gets up and eavesdrops on their conversation behind the door.]

Gwendolyn: What the heck was that? I thought you were in the Healing Coven, not the Bauble Brigade.

Healer: Mrs. Clawthorne, we have never seen a curse quite like this. I'm not sure it can be healed. Perhaps if we consult the Potions Coven, they may know a way to keep it at bay.

Gwendolyn: Keep it at bay? Oh, no. My daughter is suffering and I want that thing out! Cut it out if you have to.

[Upon hearing that, Eda gasps and covers her mouth. She pants and clutches her chest. Then, she looks up and notices that her window is open. The wind blows, causing it to swing and squeak.]

Gwendolyn: [Pushes door open.] Edalyn, I'm taking you to someone else. [Looks up.] Huh?

[Gwendolyn notices the open window. Scene then cuts to Eda running through a forest. She eventually stops to catch her breath, then starts walking while looking around.]

Young Eda: I never knew this was back here.

[Eda trips over something and falls down. She turns around to see what made her fell.]

Young Eda: Huh?

[Eda notices a suitcase-like thing buried in the sand. She picks it up and wipes off the dirt on its surface, revealing an eye shape. The eye then flashes, and the suitcase flies off Eda’s hand. It folds open, with a key turning the lock, unlocking it. A door then opens, revealing it to be a portal leading to an unknown realm.]

Young Eda: [Squints.] What?

Gwendolyn: [Distant.] Edalyn! Edalyn, is that you?

[Eda hesitates, then runs through the portal. The portal folds up and disappears. Gwendolyn comes out from behind a bush.]

Gwendolyn: [Looks around.] Edalyn! Edalyn!

[Gwendolyn stops. She looks down with a sad expression, then looks up to her right with a determined expression.]

Gwendolyn: I will find a way to cure you, Edalyn. No matter what it takes.

-OPENING THEME-

[Back at the Owl House in the present. An alarm clock is screaming. Eda grabs it and throws it at the wall, destroying it. She gets out from her nest, goes up to her mirror, and screws in her fake gold fang. After that, she shaves feathers off her leg. She then opens a cupboard stocked up with elixirs. She takes one out, drinks it and blaghs. Back in her room, she puts on a new dress and tears part of the front off.]

Eda: Ah, there we go. Mama like.

[At the kitchen, Luz sleeps with her head atop a pile of books while snoring.]

Eda: Beans!

[Luz jolts up, cries out and falls backwards.]

Eda: We ran out of apple blood. [Kicks the fridge door close and turns around.] Still no luck?

Luz: [Gets up.] None. And I was up all night. I read every tome, book, notepad, and tea leaf. [Shows Eda a cup, with the tea leaf forming into a shrugging person.] But nothing explains how to make a portal to the Human Realm.

Eda: I wish I could help ya, kid. My door was already pretty old when I found it.

Luz: How long did you have it?

Eda: Well...

[From somewhere, Lilith starts screaming. Both Eda and Luz gasp. They run to the living room, just in time to see Lilith beginning to turn into her beast form.]

Lilith: Help... me.

[Eda rushes over and takes out a bottle of elixir from beneath a pillow on the couch. She then runs towards Lilith.]

Eda: Calm down, just calm down. [Feeds Lilith the elixir.] The curse acts stronger when you're stressed.

[Lilith's feathers disappear.]

Lilith: [Pants.] That was... horrible. How have you managed all these years?

Eda: Well, it's been hard. [Helps Lilith up.] But since we split the curse, at least the elixirs are working again.

Lilith: That's a relief.

[Lilith notices her left hand gone. She makes a terrified noise while Luz cries out in shock.]

Eda: [Bends down to pick up Lilith’s hand.] Oh, yeah, sorry. Side effect of the curse. It's actually fun once in a while. [Sets the hand back in place.] Now don't worry. I've stashed elixirs all over the house. [Reveals hidden elixirs under the couch seat, behind a flower pot and pulls one out of Luz's hood.] Whenever you start feeling feathery, just help yourself to one of these bad boys.

Luz: [Claps her hands.] Ooh!

Lilith: [Regretfully.] I had no idea this is what I did to you. I am so, so sorry.

Eda: Eh, at least I got company now. [Hands Lilith a bottle of elixir.] And you got me if you need anything.

[Eda pats on Lilith's shoulder and walks out. Lilith then lies down on the couch, and notices a few bottle of elixirs taped to the ceiling.]

Lilith: [Smiles.] Hmm.

[Scene cuts to Eda and Luz outside the Owl House. Luz walks up to Eda.]

Eda: As I was saying, I've had the portal door for years. But I originally just found it in the dirt. Never figured out who made it or where it came from. I just kept it to myself.

Luz: Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

Eda: [Raises eyebrow.] Why? Suddenly curious about my past?

Luz: [Serious expression.] Always. Always curious.

Eda: Well, I may have been using it to hide from someone.

Luz: Hide from who?

Gwendolyn: [From a distance.] Probably me!

[A sudden strong gust of wind starts blowing, forcing Eda and Luz to shut their eyes and shield their faces. Scene cuts to a bird flying and a tornado coming towards them.]

Luz: [Surprised.] Magic bird tornado?

[The tornado stops, and Gwendolyn lands in front of them. The bird lands back on her staff, turning into a palisman.]

Gwendolyn: Hello, little witchlet. [Vanishes her staff, then runs forward with open arms.] Come here.

Eda: Gwendolyn. [Stops Gwendolyn from coming closer by pressing her hand on her head.]

Gwendolyn: Oof. Are we still on that? I'm your mother. Call me "Mom".

Luz and Lilith: [Shocked.] Mom?!

Gwendolyn: It is so good to see you again. [Squeezes Eda’s face with both hands.] How are you feeling? Are you eating well? I heard all about the Petrification Ceremony. Trust me, I have a lot of strong words for that Belos.

Lilith: [Jumps onto Eda's back and stands in front of her.] Mother! Mother, you know, I was there too.

Gwendolyn: Oh, hello to you too, sweet flea. [Touches Lilith’s hair.] Still dyeing your hair, I see. Well, it's very sleek. Now give me a moment with Edalyn, dear. It's important.

[Lilith looks surprised, then becomes sad and backs off.]

Gwendolyn: That's right! Today, I am about to complete a 30-year mission.

Eda: [Annoyed expression.] Oh, no.

Gwendolyn: Your mother has finally succeeded.

Eda: [Pinches her eyebrows.] Here it comes.

Gwendolyn: Today, I shall be curing [Spins her staff and jabs it on the ground.] your curse!

Eda: [Digs ear.] No, thanks.

Luz and Lilith: What?!

Eda: I said, "No, thanks." I got my elixir system. I'm good.

Gwendolyn: But... But who knows what they put in those nasty concoctions?

Eda: Actually, I do. And... [Grabs Gwendolyn's staff.] would you look at the time? [Makes Gwendolyn sit on her staff.] I got a lot to do today. So sad to see you go. Okay, bye!

[Eda slaps on Gwendolyn's staff and sends her flying away. She then dusts off her hands.]

Eda: Moms. Am I right?

[Luz and Lilith look at Eda with a completely shocked expression on their faces.]

Lilith: [Frustrated.] I haven't seen Mother in forever! And she was handing you a cure on a silver platter!

Luz: I'd kill to see my mom right now, and you just launch yours into the sky?!

Eda: Oh, listen, she comes around every year, toting a new cure for my curse. [Starts walking into the house.] But they never work, so I am done getting my hopes up.

Lilith: [Disbelief.] Mother visits Edalyn... regularly? [Follows Eda into the house.]

[Luz looks to her left. Gwendolyn lands, then walks away with sad expression. Luz makes a pitiful sound.]

Luz: [From a distance.] Mrs. Clawthorne?

[Gwendolyn turns around.]

Luz: Wait! [Runs up to Gwendolyn.] I'm Luz. Eda's apprentice. I think what you're doing is so sweet. Eda can just be so... Eda sometimes.

Gwendolyn: Call me Gwen, dear. But please don't blame Edalyn. It was the curse that created the rift between us.

Luz: I understand. Right now, there's an actual rift between me and my mom in the Human Realm.

Gwendolyn: Human Realm? Hmm. [Gasps.] My dear, I may know how to fix both our rifts.

Luz: [Excited.] Really?

Gwendolyn: I've heard some information that may assist you on your quest. Help me cure Eda's curse and that information is yours.

Luz: [Exhilarated.] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Where do we start?

Gwendolyn: We'll be consulting someone... [Grabs her necklace, the rune on it starts flashing.] very special.

[Scene cuts to Luz and Gwendolyn walking someplace.]

Luz: So we're gonna meet a curse expert? This is so rad.

Gwendolyn: Yes, after years of dealing with the Healing Coven, I finally found someone who promised me a cure. [Stops.] Ah! Here we are.

[Gwendolyn and Luz are standing in front of a stone door. Gwendolyn walks up to it and displays her necklace. The door flashes, then opens up, revealing a cave. Gwendolyn and Luz walks into the cave. Inside, an old witch with four hands is sitting on an altar. A gremlin with boils on his eyelids kneels in front of him.]

Gremlin: Please, they're so itchy.

[The old witch waves his hand, casting a spell circle. A circle of purple light surrounds the gremlin and lifts him up. The light then flashes, and after that, the gremlin is healed. Gwendolyn and Luz gasps at the sight of that, with Gwendolyn looking happy and Luz looking shocked. The gremlin is then put down on the ground.]

Gremlin: Boils, they're... they're gone! Thank you, Wortlop. Thank you. [Runs away, crying happily.]

Gwendolyn: That's Master Wortlop. He's a traveling curse expert who's perfected next-level healing magic.

[Master Wortlop gestures for Gwendolyn to come over.]

Gwendolyn: Ooh.

[Gwendolyn pushes Luz aside and passes her staff to her. She walks up to Wortlop and kneels in front of him.]

Master Wortlop: Gwendolyn, my pupil. Your aura is shining bright.

Gwendolyn: It took many months, but I was able to gather the sacred items you requested. [Takes out an egg.] The copper egg from the Snowy Rib Cage, [Takes out a dagger.] the silver dagger from the Swampy Toes, and [Takes out a chalice.] the golden chalice from the desert of Palm Stings.

Master Wortlop: You're a dedicated mother, aren't you?

[Master Wortlop summons a tome out of thin air.]

Master Wortlop: Inside this tome is the healing ability you seek. [Passes it over to Gwendolyn.] But keep it away from the eyes of non-believers, for many will be blinded by the power it holds.

[Gwendolyn looks at the tome in awe.]

Gwendolyn: I understand. [Stands up and bows to Master Wortlop.] I am in your debt, Master Wortlop.

[Gwendolyn turns around and walks away with Luz. Luz stops, looks at Master Wortlop admiringly, then runs off to catch up with Gwendolyn. Scene changes to outside the Owl House. Gwendolyn drives a sign into the ground while Luz writes "APPLE BLOOD" and draws an arrow pointing away from the house. King looks at them from inside the house through a window.]

King: Isn't it amazing, Francois? If Eda's mom can just pop up, who says my dad can't?

[Luz follows Gwendolyn deeper into the forest. King stretches his arms.]

King: Nyeh! Better get my hugging arms ready.

Lilith: Ha!

[King opens his eyes and stares at Lilith. She is lying on the couch eating ice cream.]

Lilith: Yeah, good luck with all that dad stuff. [Munches.] Sometimes it doesn't matter how dutiful you are or successful you are, parents just won't give you the time of day.

King: Don't listen to her, Francois. My dad won't be like that.

Lilith: [Sneers.] Right. Your mysterious father, who didn't even stick around to watch you hatch.

[King stares at Lilith with a devastated expression.]

Lilith: [Dejected.] Looks like you and I are in the same boat, King.

[King whimpers and clutches Francois closer to himself. Scene cuts to the forest. Luz ties up a rope and wipes off sweat from her forehead.]

Gwendolyn: Nice work, Luz. [Her palisman drops her on a stone.] With Wortlop's tome and your ability to lure Eda out of the house, we'll be curing that curse in no time.

Luz: Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's always down for more apple blood. So, [Stands up.] that Wortlop guy was really something. You're his pupil?

Gwendolyn: [Looks up from her tome.] Oh, yes. But first, I had to prove that I was worthy of his secrets. So I spent the last year on a bunch of dangerous quests. And [Flashes her bicep muscles.] I didn't even get that many scars.

Luz: [Amazed.] Cool. Also, dang, girl, [Compares her bicep to Gwendolyn's.] your bicep game is ridiculous.

[Someone steps on a stick and causes leaves to rustle.]

Gwendolyn: [Gasps.] Our signs must've worked. [Runs away together with Luz.]

Eda: [Follows the signs into the woods.] Oh, baby, time to stock up on Mama's night juice.

[Gwendolyn and Luz overlook Eda from a tree branch high up.]

Gwendolyn: According to Wortlop's tome, we start by lowering the beast's defenses with special crystals. And they're supposed to be quite calming.

Eda: Whoa!

[Eda narrowly avoids a falling crystal, spins her staff to shatter the rest, then narrowly avoids another falling crystal.]

Eda: [Stares at the ground oddly.] Knife season came early this year.

[A large shadow looms over Eda. Eda looks up, screams and jumps back, narrowly avoid a large crystal. She lies on the ground, looking shocked. A bunch of feathers pops out of her.]

Luz: [Gasps.] She's stressed.

[Luz takes out an elixir from her pouch. She is about to throw it to Eda, but Gwendolyn grabs her hand and stops her.]

Gwendolyn: Oh, no, no, no. The texts say those feathers mean we're driving the beast out.

Luz: Oh. [Stares down at the elixir with a worried expression.]

Gwendolyn: [Puts her hand on the elixir.] Don't worry. After today, Eda will never have to drink those nasty little things again.

Luz: [Smiles.] All right. What do we do next?

Gwendolyn: Next, we're gonna put that beast [Releases a puff of smoke from her bag, which forms a cloud with a face.] on ice.

[The cloud spouts out ice from its mouth. Back at the Owl House, Lilith and King are lying on the couch. They both groan from eating too much ice cream.]

King: How do you get a parent's attention?

Lilith: Heck if I know. Mother wasn't even at my Coven Initiation. [Munches another spoonful of ice cream.]

King: At least you know what she looks like. [Sits up.] All I have is an old wall carving. What if that's just graffiti?

Hooty: [Opens the door.] Heh, that's, uh, [Stretches into the living room.] that's an awful lot of ice cream you guys are eating. [Stretches towards Lilith with a wary expression.] You know Eda gets that stuff from the Night Market, right?

Lilith: [Points at Hooty accusingly.] Are you my mother? Because that is an awful lot of judgment.

King: This stinks. [Throws away the ice cream container on his head.] If my dad doesn't care about me, why should I [Drops Francois.] care about him? Hmm? Well, I'm not going to him. He's gonna have to come to me! [Lies down with his arms crossed.]

Lilith: [Sits up angrily.] And I am sick of being overlooked. From now on I... [Stands up angrily.] I have no mother! And I... I'd say that to her face!

King: [Stands up.] Yeah!

Hooty: [Hesitantly.] Isn't that taking it a bit too far?

King: It's not taking it far enough. Go tell her. [Gestures towards outside.] Go on. She's right outside.

Lilith: [Surprised.] She is?

King: Yeah, I saw her go off with Luz. I think they're gonna heal Eda's curse or whatever.

Lilith: [Realization.] Uh, oh. Is that so? Mother paying attention to Edalyn... again. I mean, [Waves her hands.] it's not like I care.

[Lilith sets her arms akimbo and grins. A bunch of feathers pop out of her face. Hooty slowly retreats away from her.]

King: [Hesitantly.] You got, uh, uh... [Points to his face.] You got a little, uh, hmm...

[Lilith gasps, then turns around to lift up the couch seat. There's nothing but feathers.]

Lilith: Where— [Notices the elixirs gone.]

[Lilith lifts up the flower pot.]

Lilith: Are— [Notices the elixirs gone too.]

[Lilith opens the cupboard door.]

Lilith: The elixirs?! [Finds it empty.]

[Lilith starts covering her face and sobs. She drops to the ground on her knees, still sobbing. King pops out from behind the door.]

King: [Hesitantly.] Lilith?

[King walks into the room. Hooty follows King from behind. Lilith suddenly jolts up and lets out a terrifying scream. Her eyes turn black and her voice becomes deeper. Scene cuts to Hooty and King watching Lilith turn into the Raven Beast with a terrified expression. Her shadow looms over the duo.]

King: [Tries to offer his ice cream.] ...Weh?

[Scene cuts back to the forest.]

Eda: [Climbs up a cliff.] This... better be... the oldest, strongest, stinkiest apple blood [Looks up.] ever.

[Eda sees a sign which says "IT REALLY IS ¡THAT GOOD!" and screams in frustration. She then begrudgingly keeps on walking, but accidentally slips on some gooey substance.]

Eda: Ah! [Balances herself, looks down at her shoes and groans.] I just stole these.

[Eda keeps on walking, but accidentally steps into a trap covered with leaves, which sends her flying upwards, screaming. Gwendolyn looks at this with a serious expression while Luz is shocked at the sight of this.]

Gwendolyn: It seems like the curse isn't my daughter's only problem.

[Eda screams and lands on a bush. Her Owl Staff flies to her.]

Eda: [Reaches out to her staff.] Help Mama up.

Luz: Gwen, [Turns to Gwendolyn.] we tried freezing the curse out, we tried sweating the curse out, we even tried [Shrugs.] flying snakes for some reason.

[Down below, Eda is running away from two flying snakes, screaming as Luz and Gwendolyn watch on.]

Luz: I don't think this stuff is working. Did Wortlop ever say where he learned this stuff? [Looks to Gwendolyn.]

Gwendolyn: [To a crow phone.] Yes, I'm sending it right away. [Hangs up call, crow caws and flies up.]

Luz: [Squints.] What did you just do?

Gwendolyn: It turns out [Slips some gems into a pouch.] the ancient tome is only the first [Hands over the pouch to the crow.] of a series. So, I'm trading in a few paltry family heirlooms to get the rest. [Flips open the book to read.]

Luz: [Dubious.] Let me see that book. [Walks towards Gwendolyn.]

Gwendolyn: [Stops Luz.] Halt. Only people who have scaled Wortlop's [Displays her necklace.] "Pyramid of Study" can touch the tome.

[Luz grabs the tome off Gwendolyn's hands using vines from a plant glyph.]

Gwendolyn: Hey!

Luz: [Flips open book.] What is this? Jar of bees for existential dread? Aromatherapy for broken legs? Bird songs for sufferers of stuffy noses?! [Turns towards Gwendolyn.] Gwen, you're being scammed! Wortlop is a fake.

Gwendolyn: You really think I'd spend my life savings [Takes back the tome.] on a fake?

Luz: I know you want what's best for Eda, and so do I. [Takes out an elixir from her waist pouch.] But I'm calling this off. [Walks off and kneels down on one leg.]

Gwendolyn: Luz, [Grabs her arm.] I really thought [Takes away the elixir.] we were on the same side. According to Wortlop, poison like this is made by healers and potion makers who simply [Flips open book.] want money.

Luz: [Angrily.] Are you kidding me?! You just... [Pinches her eyebrows.] Argh, whatever. I'll just get more at the house.

Gwendolyn: I'm afraid that will be a waste of your time.

[Her palisman drops a sack filled with elixirs in front of Gwendolyn.]

Gwendolyn: Hawksley cleared out every bottle hours ago.

Luz: Whoa. [Stands up angrily.] Why would you do that?

Gwendolyn: Because I am a mother who will do anything for her daughter.

[Gwendolyn tries to throw a bottle of elixir away, but Luz pounces on her and tries to grab the elixir, causing both of them to fall.]

Eda: Ugh. [Throws away a flying snake stuck in her hair.] Woo, this ain't good.

[Behind Eda, both Gwendolyn and Luz scream as they fall from above. They land behind a bush while the elixers shatters when the bag hits the ground, which grabs Eda's attention. They both grimace in pain, with Gwendolyn rubbing her forehead.]

Eda: Hey!

[Both look up.]

Eda: What is going on here? [Looks at both of them.]

Gwendolyn: Witchlet, [Pats off leaf on her shoulder.] it's okay. [Puts hand on Luz’s shoulder.] Luz and I are working to heal you.

[Luz stares at Eda with a guilty expression.]

Eda: What? This was all you? [Becomes angry.] You weren't healing me. You nearly killed me!

[As Eda speaks, more feathers start popping out from her body.]

Luz: Eda, please try to stay calm.

Eda: Why? Why should I be calm? I have a right to be upset!

[While speaking, Eda closes her eyes, when she opens it again before finishing the last word, it turns fully black. She transforms into her Owl Beast form in front of Luz and Gwendolyn. Scene changes to her lying face down in the shadowy void with her eyes closed. The Owl Beast steps in front of her, rumbling the ground. Eda opens her eyes and notices the large Owl Beast standing in front of her.]

Eda: Ooh, let's get this over with.

[Eda turns around and starts running away, panting. Scene cuts back to the forest, Eda in her Owl Beast form is closing in on Gwendolyn and Luz while growling.]

Gwendolyn: Don't worry. According to this, [Casts spell circle to summon tome and look at it.] we just have to... [Hesitates.] Uh...

Luz: Have to what?

Gwendolyn: [Turns around to show Luz the tome.] Buy the next volume...?

[Luz takes a deep breath, then makes an exasperated grunt. Eda roars and takes a step closer towards them. Behind them, King screams and runs out from a bush. He notices Owl Beast Eda and cries out in shock.]

Luz: King?!

King: So Lilith was feeling stressed and, uh, the light glyph didn't really work. So, uh... uh... uh...

[A large shadow flies past them from above. They all look up, some gasp. Lilith in her Raven Beast form turns around and lands in front of them, revealing herself to be much larger than Owl Beast Eda.]

King: She turned into that thing!

Gwendolyn: [Shocked.] Sweet flea?

[Lilith lets out a loud roar. Eda roars and rushes towards her, with her rushing towards Eda as well. Lilith then snatches Eda and flies off with her, while Luz, King and Gwendolyn look on in total disbelief. Luz picks up the Owl staff and rides atop it, ready to take off.]

Gwendolyn: [Disbelief.] That... was my little sweet flea? That means she's also...

King: Cursed! Yes! Were you not paying any attention to her? [Climbs up the Owl staff and sits behind Luz.]

Luz: We have to help them. Will you [Reaches out her hand.] come with me?

Gwendolyn: [Hesitates.] This... This must be part of the process, right?

Luz: [Closes her eyes.] I can see you still need a little time. [Opens eyes.] Alright, Owlbert. [Owlbert hoots.] Let's fly!

[Gwendolyn looks at Luz flying away with a hesitant expression while clutching her necklace. She then turns around and flies towards the other direction on her staff.]

Gwendolyn: [Clutches her necklace.] Wortlop... he's not a fake, is he? [Lands in front of the cave door.] After everything I did for him...

[The cave door is not fully closed, leaving a gap for Gwendolyn to peep inside. She sees something and gasps. Inside, someone has hung up Master Wortlop’s clothing accessories. The camera zooms out, revealing four gremlins surrounded by piles of snails. One of the gremlins is trying on some jewelries. A fire pit with fire bees in it can be seen in the middle of the cave. ]

Gremlin #1: Hey, what do you wanna call this one? [Dugs up a pile of dirt with his hands and put them in a jar.]

Gremlin #2: [Staring at his jewelries.] Eh, I don't know. Cleansing mud?

Gremlin #3: Yeah, from the Healing Bogs of the Hips or whatever. What do you think? [Looks to Gremlin #4.]

Gremlin #4: I think [Turns around covering his eyes.] we're gonna be rich! [Puts down his hands, revealing some fake boils on his eyelids.]

[All four gremlins laugh. The fire suddenly becomes bigger, causing them to scream and scamper away. The fire is then separated by Gwendolyn using a spell circle. She gazes ahead with a furious expression. Three of the gremlins rush to the altar and put on the clothing accessories, pretending to be Master Wortlop.]

"Master Wortlop": Mrs. Clawthorne? [Clears throat, changes to a deeper voice.] What a fortuitous surprise.

Gwendolyn: [Sternly.] You know, right after Eda was cursed I joined the Beast Keeper Coven. [A fire bee lands on her finger, then flies away.] I thought they surely would know what to do. [Walks towards "Master Wortlop".] But the beast keepers told me the curse couldn't be tamed. And the healers told me it couldn't be [Changes to sad expression.] healed. Eda told me she found something that made it manageable at least. But I didn't listen.

"Master Wortlop": I could give you the next volume. 5% off? 10% off?

Gwendolyn: [Sternly.] Leave.

[The fire behind her becomes larger, startling "Master Wortlop". Gwendolyn gives him a death stare with the fire burning behind her.]

Gwendolyn: [Sternly.] And if I ever see you in Bonesborough again, every beast in the forest will be after your head!

[The three gremlins jump out from under the robe, scream and immediately dig their way underground. The fire immediately dies down back to the original fire pit size.]

Gwendolyn: [Chuckles.] Still got it.

[Scene cuts to a shot of Bonesborough. Owl Beast Eda and Raven Beast Lilith both fly past the camera. Eda tries to escape Lilith, but she keeps on pursuing her. Lilith manages to catch Eda and pins her to the ground, damaging some buildings among the process and causing people to flee in terror. Eda kicks Lilith off her and flies away. Lilith growls and pursues Eda again. They continue fighting each other in air and eventually, both crash to the ground. Luz and King fly past on the Owl Staff just in time to see this. ]

Luz: [Anxiously.] Gotta think fast. [Notices something ahead.] Whoo!

Morton: [Dejectedly.] No one's bought anything in a while. [Reaches to the wooden panel handle.] I should close up shop.

Luz: [From a distance.] Morton!

Morton: [Looks up.] Hmm?

[Luz lands in front of Mr. Elixir, almost crashing into Morton, causing him to cry out in surprise.]

Luz: I need every last elixir you have.

[Morton gasps happily.]

Luz: Also, do you accept [Takes out a drawing of Morton from her pocket.] payment in hyper-realistic pencil portraits? [Grins at Morton.]

[Morton becomes unhappy and closes the panel door in front of Luz.]

Luz: Shoot! I thought I was improving. [Looks down at the drawing sadly.]

Gwendolyn: [From a distance.] Don't worry!

[Luz and King turn around in surprise. Gwendolyn lands in front of them and spins her staff. She is carrying a large bag of snails.]

Gwendolyn: Mama's here. [Shows the bag of snails.]

[Scene cuts back to Eda and Lilith. Eda roars at Lilith. Lilith attempts to bite Eda, but she manages to dodge her and fly away. Eda then lands atop a roof, while Lilith catches up with her and pins her down. Luz, King and Gwendolyn watch them from another roof across the duo.]

Luz: You sure this is gonna work? [Glances over at Gwendolyn.]

King: Yeah, [Squints at Gwendolyn.] are you like, secretly sending us to our deaths?

Gwendolyn: [Sternly.] No, I'm making things right.

[Gwendolyn pulls off her necklace, throws it down and steps on it, breaking the necklace into pieces. Luz and King ride onto the Owl Staff and fly away. Eda appears on screen and screeches. Gwendolyn casts a spell circle, summoning some flying boards to her. She approaches Eda and Lilith by stepping onto the boards.]

Gwendolyn: [Regretfully.] My beautiful daughters, I failed you.

[Eda turns towards Gwendolyn. She snarls and walks towards her.]

Gwendolyn: Edalyn? You're in there, aren't you?

[Eda growls at Gwendolyn, but she puts her hand on Eda's hair anyway. The camera zooms into Eda's eye. The scene then changes to the shadowy void, where Eda is still running away from the Owl Beast. While she's doing so, Gwendolyn's voice can be heard coming from outside.]

Gwendolyn: I should've listened to you. I know now why you pushed me away.

Eda: [Stops running.] Uh, Mom?

Gwendolyn: I made you think your curse was something to be ashamed of.

[The Owl Beast rushes towards Eda and screeches at her, while Eda stares down at it.]

Gwendolyn: Whether we want it or not, it's a part of you. And I love every part of you.

[Eda stops the Owl Beast with her hand. Light flashes in between her hand and the beast. The Owl Beast screeches, gradually shrinking. It eventually becomes small, and runs away tweeting.]

Eda: [Calls out.] Mom, I can hear you. And you...

[Eda pounces on the Owl Beast and pins it down, putting it in a chokehold.]

Eda: My turn to drive.

[Scene cuts back to Gwendolyn. She shuts her eyes and puts her forehead into Eda’s forehead.]

Gwendolyn: [Regretfully.] I'm so sorry.

Eda: Mom?

[Gwendolyn opens her eyes to find Eda staring back at her, her eyes already revert back to normal.]

Gwendolyn: Witchlet! [Hugs Eda.]

[Lilith roars and attempts to pounce at Eda, but Eda grabs her wrist and pins her down.]

Gwendolyn: And Lilith... [Kneels down in front of her.] you were always so self-sufficient.

[Gwendolyn caresses Lilith’s cheek, calming her down.]

Gwendolyn: [Regretfully.] But I didn't give you the attention you deserved.

[Upon hearing that, Raven Beast Lilith starts sobbing. Gwendolyn shushes her and embraces her, caressing her head.]

Gwendolyn: [Looks up and shouts.] Now!

[Luz and King flies towards them from above. King jumps down from the staff, pinning Eda and Lilith down by stepping on their ears. Luz pulls out the bottle corks with her teeth, and dumps the elixirs into Eda's and Lilith's mouth. A cloud of air appears and surrounds the duo. The strong airflow forces Gwendolyn to shield her face and blows King backwards. King almost rolls off the roof, but Luz lands just in time to catch him. The cloud expands and flashes brightly, then forms then shape of a bird. Eda and Lilith is pulled upwards. The cloud eventually bursts and gives off a bright flash.]

Luz: [Impressed.] Dang, that is good elixir.

[Gwendolyn walks forward. Eda and Lilith descend from above, right into Gwendolyn's arms. She sits down with them in her arms and stares at Eda lovingly.]

Eda: [Opens her eyes and smiles at Gwendolyn.] About time, Mom.

Lilith: [Sobs.] Mom, I heard you but I couldn't stop myself. I... I couldn't do anything. [Continues sobbing.]

Gwendolyn: [Hugs Lilith.] It's okay. Everything is okay now. [Hugs Eda together.] I'm here for you both.

[Luz smiles gladly at the sight of this, while King comes to a realization.]

King: She was... trying to do her best, huh?

[Gwendolyn hugs her daughters tight and smiles lovingly as Luz and King look at them from aside. Scene changes. It is now nighttime and Luz, King, Eda and Gwendolyn are standing outside the Owl House.]

Gwendolyn: I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused, but I—I just wanted to help. I should've trusted you more.

Eda: Yeah, you [Jokingly punches Gwendolyn.] should've. But, hey, don't be a stranger. Okay, Mom?

[Gwendolyn smiles at Eda.]

Lilith: [Kicks open the door.] Mom! I'm ready! [Carries a bindle on her shoulder.]

Eda: [Squints at Lilith.] Huh?

Lilith: [Walks towards Gwendolyn.] Well, we were talking and I've decided to go home with Mother and make up for lost time. [Smiles at Gwendolyn.]

[Luz, Eda, King and Hooty are surprised at this announcement.]

Luz: What?

Eda: Lily?

King: You lived here?

Hooty: What?

Gwendolyn: [Sad expression.] Edalyn, Lilith told me how she gave you the curse. I am [Grabs Lilith's hand.] so, so sorry to [Grabs Eda's hand.] you both, to have this secret weighing you down. [Regretfully.] I wish I knew sooner.

Lilith: [To Eda.] There's still a lot to be learned about this curse, but... it'll be nice to spend some time home and reconnect with Dad. [Eda looks away hearing the last part.]

Gwendolyn: We'll be away for a while, but we have plenty of [Takes out a few elixirs from her hair.] elixirs stocked up!

Luz: Someday my hair is gonna be big enough to do that too. [Looks at Gwendolyn admiringly.]

King: [Incredulously.] You actually want that?

Hooty: [Cries, stretches towards Lilith.] No! Lulu, you can't!

Lilith: [Touches Hooty’s cheek.] Hootsifer, I have to. But don't worry, we can be penpals. [Turns around and leaves.]

Hooty: [Cries.] But I can't hold a pen!

Gwendolyn: [Gratefully.] Luz, if it weren't for you I might still be wrapped up in Wortlop's lies. So here's what I should've told you from the start. [Bends over towards Luz.] You're not the only human to have lived in Bonesborough.

[Luz gasps.]

Gwendolyn: There's a rare substance called Titan's blood. It is extremely powerful and sometimes causes leaks between our realms. Plants, animals... And you guys have a lot of garbage, by the way. But humans are rare. My great-grandmother told me about a human who once lived here. But one day he just vanished. Rumor has it he left something in the library, and if you can find out more about him...

Luz: [Hopefully.] Maybe I could find out how he got here!

Gwendolyn: Exactly. [Winks at Luz.]

[Lilith and Gwendolyn look back and smile, then fly away together on their staffs. Hooty is still crying.]

Eda: Well, I'll be on the couch for the next twenty-four hours. [Yawns and starts walking into the house.] Goodnight.

King: No, wait! I call couch.

Luz: [Puts her hand over her heart and looks up to the sky.] I'll be home soon, Mom.

[A gust of wind blows past Luz.]

Luz: [Looks down sadly.] Camp's probably ended [Looks back up to sky.] by now.

[Scene changes to another shot further away from the Owl House. Luz looks up to the sky with a sad expression while Hooty is still crying in the background.]

Luz: She must be so worried.

[Scene transitions to the human realm with an exterior shot of the Noceda residence. It is night and lights can be seen coming out through the windows on the right side of the house. Scene then changes, showing Camila sitting on a couch inside the living room, covering her face with her hands while crying.]

Camila: [Straightens up, wipes off tears with her finger.] I'm sorry. These animal documentaries [Turns off TV with remote control.] make me such a mess.

"Luz": Here, Mama.

[A hand offers Camila a tissue box. Scene changes to show another Luz sitting on the couch, but her face is covered in darkness, concealing her facial features.]

Camila: Thank you, Luz. You always know what to do.

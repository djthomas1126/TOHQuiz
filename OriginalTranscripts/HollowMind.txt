Luz: What is this place?

Hunter: You know exactly where we are, human.

[Luz turns around to find Hunter staring at her angrily.]

Hunter: [Furiously.] You got us trapped in the Emperor's mind!

Luz: Huh?!

[Back to Hunter and Luz inside Belos' mindscape. Luz looks around incredulously.]

Luz: We're in the Emperor's mind? That's bananas!

Hunter: I don't know what those are, and I don't care too. Remember what happened at the Night Market?

[Scene flashes back to earlier at the Night Market.]

Peddler: Teeth! Get your teeth! We got all varieties and qualities!

[The peddler puts his hand on a person's shoulder.]

Peddler: I even do trades.

[The peddler takes out a pair of pliers as he speaks. The person he puts his hand on turns around, who is revealed to be Hunter in his Golden Guard attire. This catches the peddler by surprise.]

Peddler: Oh, I... mean, why would I trade teeth? That's illegal and unsanitary. But, I mean, if you're interested...

[Hunter notices three hooded, suspicious figures walking nearby.]

Hunter: [Narrating.] I heard whispers of an attempt to invade the Emperor's mind with wild magic. I decided to take the villains out myself.

[Hunter follows the three hooded figures into an alley and hides behind a barrel. Although not outright shown, the three figures are implied to be Raine, Darius, and Eberwolf. After Eberwolf finishes drawing some circles on the ground, Raine starts playing their flute, while Darius mixes up some liquid in a test tube he is holding. He then puts the test tube on the ground, and transforms his left hand into an Abomination hammer, preparing to break it.]

Hunter: [Narrating.] But just as I was about to stop them...

[Hunter jumps out from behind the barrel and confronts the trio.]

Hunter: Halt! For crimes [Takes out his mechanical staff.] against the Emperor, you are under arrest!

[Luz suddenly pops up from below and blocks the screen.]

Luz: Oh, wait! I remember now!

Hunter: Hey!

[The scene behind Luz starts rewinding as she ducks back down. The entire scene rewinds back to some point of time earlier. When it stops, it shows a door with a glass panel, and a sign with the "OPEN" part facing the camera. The scene is taken from inside a building.]

Luz: [Narrating.] Eda took me and King to the Night Market to repair my witch's wool cape. But, we ran into some trouble.

[Eda knocks on the glass panel.]

Eda: Hello? Prim? Did you get into the Night Juice again? [Sing-songy.] Hello?

[Scene cuts to Eda and Luz outside the door. King's voice comes up from a walkie-talkie Luz is holding.]

King: Is this thing on? Demon King to Luzura, you copy?

[Luz turns to her left to and calls out to King.]

Luz: Sure do!

[King pops out from a tub filled with skulls.]

King: [In a low voice.] Use the walkie!

Luz: Oh, uh, right. [Turns around.] 10-4, Demon King. Luzura here with Echo, Delta, Alfa. What's your 20? Over.

King: Uh, oh. Uh... Hable m√°s lento, por favor. [Subtitles: Speak more slowly please.]

Luz: Aw, you remembered your lesson. But that wasn't Spanish, buddy. I read you loud and clear! Over.

Eda: Hey, Prim!

[Eda bangs on the glass panel again. Someone finally opens the door.]

Eda: Ah, there you are. [Squats down.] I need more witch's wool. I got a kid with cold shoulders and a knack for gettin' into trouble.

Prim: The shop is closed, Eda. I've... finally decided to join a coven.

[Prim shows Eda and Luz an Oracle Coven sigil on her wrist, much to Eda's dismay.]

Prim: Emperor Belos says wild witches celebrate destruction and... pain.

Eda: I mean, I know I can be... abrasive, but-

Prim: He also says that the Titan punishes those who aid wild witches. I can't have you here.

[Prim shuts the door. Luz glances over at Eda, then becomes angry.]

Luz: Well, what does he know?! [Walks towards the door.] Belos is a liar. He just wants [Bangs on the door.] power! And I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that he can't speak to the Titan!

[Everyone around gasps.]

Purple-haired witch: Do you think she's right?

Yellow demon with horns: Don't let the Titan hear you say that. Belos says he can read minds.

Purple-haired witch: What even is a doughnut?

[The crowd disperses. Eda notices people's reaction and calls out to Luz.]

Eda: Hey, I'll be fine. You're the one who needs to be careful.

Luz: But people should know who Belos really is!

Eda: And who is he, really?

[Luz is unable to give an answer.]

Eda: Listen, Belos has been Emperor for 50 years. Everyone is used to this. No one's gonna risk change unless you have proof that he's up to something.

[Eda notices that Luz is looking dejected.]

Eda: Ah, come on. [Punches Luz's shoulder.] We'll figure something out. But first, let's see if there are any respectable criminals left in this city.

[As Eda speaks, she stands up and takes out her Owl Staff from her hair, then walks away while everyone around gives her dirty looks and whisper among themselves. King walks up to Luz.]

Luz: I hate seeing people look at Eda that way. But how can I prove he's actually evil? It feels so obvious, but no one believes me! No one answers my letters! [Groans and scratches her head.] I don't know what to do!

King: No one wants to think they've wasted their life following the wrong person. You just gotta find something big to change their minds.

[King walks away to follow Eda. Luz looks down thoughtfully.]

Luz: King's right. How can I find that something?

[Luz suddenly notices something and gasps. Not far away from her, she sees Hunter running into an alley.]

Luz: [Rolls up her sleeve.] Perfect timing.

[Scene cuts to Hunter running past a barrel. Luz's head then pops up from behind it. Scene changes again to show Hunter approaching Raine, Darius and Eberwolf while Luz sneaks up on Hunter from behind.]

Hunter: Halt!

[Raine and Darius turn around to look at Hunter. Darius restores his Abomination hammer hand to normal state.]

Hunter: For crimes against the Emperor, you are all under arrest!

Luz: Hunter!

[Luz pounces up on Hunter from behind, causing both of them to crash into the ground.]

Luz: Hey! [Takes out a pen.] Can I bug you with a few questions?

Hunter: [Sits up.] Human?!

[Raine proceeds to start playing their flute and create a smokescreen.]

Hunter: No, no, no! Stop! I forbid you to flee!

[By the time the smoke disperses, Raine, Darius and Eberwolf are all gone. Hunter groans in frustration, then turns around and takes of his mask.]

Hunter: Human! Do you know what you've just done?!

[Hunter takes out his staff, but accidentally steps onto something and breaks it, causing it to start glowing. He glances downwards and notices that he had stepped on a neon yellow vial. The liquid flashes brightly.]

Luz: Uh... what's that?

[The circles Luz and Hunter are standing in start flashing brightly, causing them to cry out in shock. The light then wraps them up and shoots up into the night sky, creating a firework. Scene cuts to Hunter's witch's staff falling to the ground, but it then transforms to Flapjack as he lands next to Hunter's mask. He looks down at the broken glass pieces sadly, then looks up and chirps.]

[Scene cuts back to Luz and Hunter in Belos' mindscape. Hunter bursts out laughing.]

Hunter: You wanna prove that my uncle is evil? And you thought I would help? [Continues laughing.]

Luz: Well, now that I'm in his mind, I can learn the truth for myself. [Notices something.] Weird though. I've been in Willow's mind once, and it had more, uh, trees.

Hunter: Eh, makes sense. Mindscapes reflect the individual. I've read a lot about this subject.

[Hunter suddenly notices something and gasps. He walks towards it.]

Hunter: Whoa, look at this memory!

[Scene cuts to a painting depicting Belos guiding people away from a burning town. Hunter and Luz approach it.]

Hunter: You know, unfettered wild magic wiped out our family. Everyone knew too much and got themselves hurt. That's why Belos took in the survivors, and dedicated his life to making the Coven System! [Runs towards another painting.] It's why he's so well-liked!

[Hunter stops next to a painting depicting people happily reaching out their hands towards Belos, who is holding a glowing floating orb with his left hand.]

Hunter: Our sigils protect us from ourselves, and make the Titan happy.

[Hunter notices another painting to his left and gasps, then walks towards it.]

Hunter: Oh! This is when I inherited my staff! You know, I'm the youngest scout to become Golden Guard. I, uh, never found out what happened to the previous one.

[Scene cuts to Luz looking at Hunter with a uneasy expression on her face.]

Hunter: Huh, why does Darius look so sad here?

[Luz starts looking around and notices the painting she first saw when she woke up. She walks up to it, and touches the part where Owl Beast Eda is drawn at with a glum look on her face. Suddenly, she hears the sound of a child crying. She follows the sound, and finds a child figure with a wooden mask similar to Belos' sitting behind a pillar sobbing. He notices Luz and immediately stands up, frightened by her presence.]

Luz: [Hesitantly.] Belos?

Hunter: Belos?

[Luz and Hunter both speak out at the same time, much to Luz's surprise. The child figure turns around and runs away.]

Luz: Huh?

[Luz turns around and notices a dark figure resembling Belos approaching them.]

Hunter: Emperor, you're here! We [Kneels down.] beg for your assistance to return to the physical world, so that I may capture your enemies! And so [Looks back at Luz annoyedly.] she can ruin someone else's day.

[The dark figure stops in front of Hunter. The child figure emerges from behind it and shakes his head and hands at the duo desperately. Luz looks at him with a puzzled expression when suddenly, the dark figure roars and starts transforming, revealing multiple glowing eyes on its body while also screeching.]

Luz: Hunter! Watch out!

[Luz rushes to the front of Hunter and takes out some fire glyphs from her pocket, then slaps on it. This creates an explosion with blasts strong enough to send everyone flying backwards. Luz and Hunter roll on the floor then crash through a wall, falling down a dark void. Luz takes out a hover glyph from her pocket, grabs onto Hunter, then activates it before they hit the ground. They manage to come to a halt near the ground, but the paper then disintegrates, causing them to crash into the ground face-first. The duo sit up, as Luz rubs her head in pain.]

Hunter: Where are we now?

[Luz looks up to see the hole they came through just now disappears.]

Luz: We must be in the Emperor's real mind.

[The duo stands up and finds themselves in a strange place filled with dead trees. Some paintings can be seen on the tree trunks.]

Hunter: What do you mean the Emperor's real mind? [Looks upwards.] That gallery-

Luz: Was made of all the lies he tells. He's not who you think he is.

[Hunter notices an abandoned palisman on the ground and picks it up. The palisman then disintegrates in his hand, causing it to tremble. Hunter clutches his hand, then stands up.]

Hunter: We're probably being punished because [Points at Luz.] you provoked his inner self.

Luz: Well, his inner self had a thousand glowing eyeballs!

Hunter: [Mockingly.] Oh, no! Eyeballs! You're so easy to scare.

[Luz looks at Hunter with an irritated expression on her face. Eda's voice suddenly comes out from Luz's walkie-talkie.]

Eda: Boo!

Hunter: [Startled.] Ah!

[Luz takes out her walkie-talkie.]

Eda: Luz, where are you? Oh, wait. Hey, blondie, your friend wants to talk to you.

Hunter: Uh...

[Flapjack's chirp comes out from Luz's walkie-talkie. Hunter immediately grabs it from Luz's hand.]

Hunter: Flapjack! Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

[Luz snatches the walkie-talkie from Hunter's hands.]

Luz: Give me that! So, Eda. We may kinda sorta be trapped in, uh... the Emperor's mind.

Eda: [Gasps.] How in the world did you- No, we don't have time for that. Has the Inner Belos spotted you yet?

Luz: Yes, but we were able to get away... with help. Can there be two inner selves?

Eda: No. But I have heard of strong emotions materializing. Just stay safe. If you're devoured in his mindscape-

Hunter: We'll be trapped! [Luz turns back to look at him pacing back and forth looking worried.] Dragged down into his subconscious forever. I... told you I read about this stuff.

King: Well, we're gonna get you out! We'll make a return spell as fast as we can!

Eda: Just don't lose the walkie-talkie. It's our only connection to you.

Luz: You got it, Owl Lady. Over and out.

Hunter: Wait!

[Hunter snatches the walkie-talkie from Luz's hand.]

Hunter: I'll be home soon, Flapjack. Stay safe.

[Flapjack chirps.]

Hunter: [Whispers.] I love you. Over and out.

[Flapjack chirps.]

Eda and King: Aww!

[Hunter ends the transmission and throws the walkie-talkie back to a grinning Luz. Suddenly, they hear sounds of leaves rustling.]

Hunter and Luz: Huh?

[They look towards the source of sound and see the child figure from before emerging from behind a tree.]

Luz: It's you! Kid Belos!

Hunter: What?

[Luz walks towards Kid Belos and kneels down to talk to him.]

Luz: Thank you for helping us before. You don't seem as scary as your inner self.

[Suddenly, from somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches, which surprises Luz and Kid Belos. He covers his ears, then runs towards Luz and grabs her arm.]

Luz: If strong emotions can take form, maybe he's the Emperor's... I don't know, sense of guilt?

Hunter: [Laughs.] What? Belos has never done anything worthy of feeling guilt. It's obviously his... uh, sense of innocence. His pure intentions!

Luz: Well, [Whispers back at Kid Belos.] whichever it is, I think he can help us stay safe. [Whispers to Kid Belos.] And maybe you can show us who Belos really is.

[Kid Belos nods.]

Hunter: What was that?

[From somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches again. Kid Belos grabs Luz's arm and drags her away.]

Luz: No time! Let's go, go, go!

[Hunter runs after the duo. Kid Belos leads Luz to a painting and jumps through it. Luz prepares to follow suit.]

Hunter: Wait! You're just gonna invade his memories? That's sacrilege!

[Somewhere above, Inner Belos screeches again.]

Luz: It's a way to survive!

[Luz grabs Hunter's arm and drags him towards the painting. Both fall into the painting together.]

[Scene cuts to outside the Owl House. Eda arrives back on the Owl staff with King and Flapjack. She then flings the door open.]

Eda: Hooty, I need you to lock down the house. Windows shut, curtains drawn, absolutely zero distractions.

[As she speaks, she grabs some stuff from the ledge above the fireplace. Flapjack hovers nearby, also grabbing an object.]

Eda: King, go grab all the textbooks you can find.

[King runs off.]

Eda: [Groans.] This is gonna be tough without magic. Hooty! Chop-chop!

Hooty: Ma'am!

[Hooty proceeds to barricade all the windows, summon some spiky plants from the ground to surround the house, and latch the front door shut with multiple locks. He then hangs a sign outside the front door which says: "BRB!". Not far away, Raine, Darius and Eberwolf are hiding in the bushes. Raine intends to go near the house, but is stopped by Darius.]

Hooty: [To Flapjack.] Oh, hey, your buddy's trapped too, right? The angry blond kid?

[At the mention of Hunter, Darius immediately rushes forward, but Raine halts him.]

Hooty: Eda's smart but... without magic, [Shakes his head sadly.] I'm afraid she can't do much.

[Raine crosses their arms as Darius scratches his head. Eberwolf pops out from a bush beside them. Raine then proceeds to write on the ground to communicate with the duo. They write: "I KNOW HOW TO GET PAST THE BIRD", "OWL?", "TUBE???", "HIM!!!" (sketch of Hooty with arrows pointing at it).]

[Scene cuts back to Belos' mindscape, where Luz and Hunter fall out of the painting Luz previously pulled them into. Kid Belos appears out of thin air in front of them, and runs away while laughing. The duo follows him to an area depicting one of Belos' memories - which takes place during Deadwardian Era somewhere in Bonesborough. Multiple townspeople have gathered in front of an empty platform. Kid Belos vanishes as he approaches the crowd, while Luz and Hunter run towards the platform and stop in front of it.]

Male townsperson: He says he can talk to the Titan.

Female townsperson: The Titan's dead, how is that possible?

[Belos steps onto the platform, the townspeople gasp.]

Belos: Fellow citizens, we are born into chaos. [Bows down.] Our lives anger the Titan. My own family has been hurt by the darkness of wild magic.

[As he's speaking, a past version of his artificial magic staff sparks and smoke comes out of it, obscuring everything around him, he starts to twirl his staff, clearing the smoke, and 9 differently colored lights shine from it.]

Belos: I've been shown the healing light, it shines in nine hues!

[The townspeople gasp in delight.]

Hunter: [Nudges Luz.] See? He's always been helping people.

[Explosions suddenly start to go off everywhere around Belos.]

Belos: The wild witches! They have found me, run!

[Scene cuts to Luz and Hunter running to an alleyway nearby, and sees another part of Belos' memory where he is standing in front of a previous Golden Guard scolding him.]

Belos: You incompetent fool! You nearly took my head off with that blast.

Previous guard: I'm sorry, Lord Belos!

Belos: I'm off to the next town.

Previous guard: Uh, what about... the rest of these?

[He takes off a blanket revealing various boxes of unused explosives.]

Belos: Put on a bigger show.

[Hunters face turns to a mix of shock and realization. The previous Golden Guard ignites the fuse, then follows Belos into a building. Kid Belos then appears, picks up a bag filled with what sounds to be glass bottles, and jumps through another painting. Luz and Hunter follow suit, and lands outside the memory.]

Luz: Belos was lying! Wild witches weren't attacking him. How could you help someone like that? [Points to Hunter.]

Hunter: That was... probably a... special technique to get people to listen to his message. It's... It's for the greater good.

[Luz looks angrily at Hunter for a second before the inner Belos starts to creep out of a memory, reaching towards Luz.]

Luz: Ah! He found us!

[Kid Belos laughs and jumps into another memory; Luz and Hunter follow him in. This memory takes place at the top of the Knee, where Belos is standing in front of a group of nine witches and demons. Kid Belos jumps up and grabs a loose rope hanging off one of them before running away.]

Hunter: What's the kid doing?

Luz: Shh!

[Belos gestures towards a burning city in front of the crowd.]

Belos: Look at what wild magic has done to your city. Now imagine what it's doing to you. A city can rise from the ashes, but a soul...

[Belos shakes his head slowly. The crowd becomes uneasy and murmurs among themselves.]

Horned witch: [Gasps.] What does that mean?

Green-eyed witch: Wait, what?

Belos: I can make your magic pure again, as the Titan intended!

[A previous Golden Guard, presumably a different one from the last, appears next to Belos, a yellow glow emitting from his finger. The crowd extends their arms outwards, and the previous guard uses his finger to brand a coven sigil onto each of them, representing all nine covens.]

Belos: Welcome, to your new covens!

[The horned witch looks down at the sigil branded onto her wrist. Suddenly, lines start to come out of it, spreading throughout her entire body as she exclaims in pain and panic. Her eyes glow, and the scene cuts to the other eight group members with the same effect as they all drop one by one to the ground, becoming unconscious. The previous guard kneels down next to the horned witch and checks her pulse.]

Previous guard: They're... still alive.

Belos: Then we still have some work to do. Gather the Palismen.

[The previous guard brings two staffs to Belos, who snatches one of the Palisman off its staff and crushes it before walking away. The horned witch gasps softly and the previous guard turns around to look at her writhing in pain before he walks away. The camera moves to Luz and Hunter standing behind her. Luz looks horrified while Hunter has a tense expression on his face. Luz then looks at him in concern. Scene changes to a view from above showing Hunter and Luz looking down at the crowd. A strong gust of wind blows past, bringing along some snow which then obscures the view. ]

[Scene cuts to outside the memory. Kid Belos jumps out of the painting while laughing. Hunter then comes out from it and runs off. Luz emerges from the painting shortly after.]

Luz: You can't deny it now. Belos is trying to hurt people!

Hunter: He was just... perfecting sigil magic! Besides, maybe, he's remembering things wrong. Who knows how mindscapes work?

[Hunter notices Kid Belos emerging from behind a tree while laughing.]

Luz: I thought you did!

Hunter: [Angrily.] Well, maybe I'm an idiot! [To Kid Belos.] You! Get back here!

[Hunter rushes towards Kid Belos, but before he can catch him, Kid Belos suddenly stops and turns around. The sound of Inner Belos screeching is then heard from behind Hunter, prompting him to turn around.]

Luz: Huh?

[Luz turns around and sees a tall and lanky skeletal Inner Belos approaching her and Hunter. It then screeches at the duo, causing them to scream in fear and immediately start running away before it can catch them. They follow Kid Belos to another painting, but Hunter suddenly hesitates and stops. He turns around to look at the Inner Belos, who is growling and slowly approaching him, causing him to retreat in fear.]

Luz: Hunter!

[Hunter looks back at Luz. She extends her hand towards him, and after hesitating for a bit, he grabs her hand. Luz then drags him into another memory of Belos'. Part of Inner Belos' skull comes through the painting, sniffs around, then leaves. Both Luz and Hunter let out a sigh of relief. Kid Belos pushes Luz's arm away, then runs forward to pick up empty glass bottles from the ground and put them into his sack. Not far away, Luz is shocked to see the portal she destroyed before has been restored.]

Luz: [Gasps.] He's got the portal?! [To Hunter pointing at the portal.] Did you know about this?

Hunter: Of course. I helped rebuild it.

Belos: I can hear you.

[Luz and Hunter appear surprised at what Belos just said. Not far away, he walks towards the portal, but then stops and looks back. From somewhere behind Luz and Hunter, someone starts laughing maniacally, prompting them to turn around and look up at a tree behind them. A pair of glowing eyes then appear from the darkness within the tree branches.]

Eyes: You caught me!

[A strange shadow in an abstract form emerges from behind a tree branch.]

Shadow: To you, who stray so far from home. To me, who's trapped beneath these bones. We'll play forever, me and you, when you paint the land in nine bright hues!

[As they speak, the shadow moves around the room and transforms into multiple abstract picture forms. Eventually, after reaching the portal, the shadow transforms to depict nine people lifting up their hands in a worshipping position. They then transform again to depict a screaming Titan and people being shattered into pieces. After that, they revert to their original form and start cackling.]

Belos: What can I do for you, Collector?

[The Collector moves towards a statue and lies down between its arms.]

The Collector: I'm bored! Is the Draining Spell ready yet? I wanna play and see everything go all...

[The Collector transforms themselves to wrap around the statue and then screams, eventually shattering into multiple pieces.]

Belos: You'll have your fun on the Day of Unity.

[As he speaks, Belos turns around and walks away from the portal. the Collector appears on the door.]

The Collector: Betrayed, beguiled, alone, deceived! We'll have our revenge on... Ugh, "unity" is so hard to rhyme.

[Luz and Hunter are bewildered by everything they have witnessed. Luz looks back at Hunter and he can only shrug. Suddenly, a projection of Hunter from the past runs through Hunter, much to the duo's surprise. Hunter then clutches his chest in shock. Scene cuts to past Hunter going up stairs towards Belos, who is standing in front of the portal.]

Past Hunter: I- I know you didn't want me going to Eclipse Lake. But if I hadn't, [Takes out the portal key.] I wouldn't have found this!

[Belos immediately snatches the key away from Hunter's hand. He then holds up the key to take a closer look, and sees some Titan's Blood leaking out of it.]

Past Hunter: Some... of the Titan blood did spill, but- but if you let me explain then-

Belos: [Sternly.] Leave. Now.

[Past Hunter looks up at Belos sadly. Scene cuts to Belos standing in front of the portal as the sound of Past Hunter's footsteps becomes further away. Eventually, the sound of door closing can be heard. The Collector then emerges from behind the portal.]

The Collector: Ooh, you were maaaaad. I thought you were gonna go all... [The Collector transforms into an image depicting Belos with multiple tentacles, then scream and wave the tentacles around.] ...on that kid.

Belos: Not as long as he stays in the right path. I say, "The Titan has big plans for you," and he does what he's told. Unlike the previous attempts.

The Collector: I'm starting to think you make those things just to destroy them. You have fun with it. Admit it! [Cackles.]

[Cut to Hunter and Luz. Luz has a sad expression on her face while Hunter looks shocked.]

Belos: Of course I don't, Collector. It hurts every time he chooses to betray me.

[Luz turns around to look at Hunter.]

[Scene cuts to outside the memory. Kid Belos jumps out from the painting and runs off. Luz comes out, then helps Hunter out of the painting.]

Luz: Sounds like he wants to wipe out all life in the Demon Realm. And the sigils help him do that.

[As Luz speaks, Hunter walks away with a pained expression on his face while she follows him behind. Not far away from them, Kid Belos puts down some objects on the ground.]

Luz: Hunter, um, listen. You don't need to return to the castle. You can stay at the Owl House if you want. I'm sure Eda would be cool with it once we... tell her what we... heard. [Expression becomes horrified.]

[Luz notices something in front of her and Hunter and becomes horrified. It is another part of Belos' memories, except this one has multiple broken Golden Guard masks on the ground. There are also some paintings on the trees depicting what happened to the previous Golden Guards. Luz suddenly hears something cracking and gasps, turning towards the source of sound. Behind her, Kid Belos is standing in a circle made out of rope and surrounded by multiple arrows and bottles of liquids. He breaks a Golden Guard mask in half and throws it into the fire.]

Luz: Hey! Stop that!

[As she speaks, Luz runs towards Kid Belos and drags him away from the fire. Hunter then proceeds to stomp out the fire.]

Luz: Why would he do that?

[Something floats past Hunter's foot, and he gets into a defensive posture. Multiple strands of this unknown substance float towards the rope circle, then form into Inner Belos, who proceeds to start screeching loudly. Luz and Hunter look at it in shock as it stomps on the ground. Its body appears to be made of dozens of small, screaming, animal-like figures.]

"Inner Belos": Get away from him! Danger! Danger! Run!

Luz: [Shocked.] Are those... Palismen...?!

Hunter: [Realization.] We weren't running from the Inner Belos. He was with us, the whole time. [Looks back at Kid Belos.]

[Behind the duo, Kid Belos is facing away from them and crying, but this soon turns into a maniacal laughter as he takes out a wooden sword and strikes the rope on the ground, transferring some sort of energy into the circle where the Palismen figure is at. This activates it and launches the bottles onto the figure. The rope then tightens around the figure, causing it to crash to the ground. Luz and Hunter turn around to look at Kid Belos, who proceeds to transform himself into Adult Inner Belos.]

Inner Belos: Hello, Hunter. Hello, Luz.

[Scene changes to show Luz and Hunter looking at Inner Belos angrily.]

Inner Belos: Ah. I was finally able to catch it. [Walks towards the figure.] This thing's been a thorn in my side for years. All these weepy Palismen souls...

[Inner Belos puts his hand on the figure, causing the figure to start turning into dust.]

Inner Belos: Their voices constantly nagging me. [Grabs a bird Palisman from the pile.] Vile. But without them, I wouldn't be able to do this.

[Inner Belos transforms his left arm into some sort of goo and squeezes the Palisman. Hunter's face is filled with shock and horror as Inner Belos proceeds to destroy the Palisman in front of him, causing him to wince.]

Inner Belos: Ah... [Turns around.] I'm feeling better already. [To Hunter.] Thank you for distracting it.

Hunter: [On the verge of crying.] What did you do to the other guards...? To our family?! It wasn't wild magic, was it?

[Inner Belos' face turns cold.]

Inner Belos: [Flicks Hunter's hair.] What a shame.

[Tears start forming in Hunter's eyes.]

Inner Belos: [Exhales.] Out of all the grimwalkers, you looked the most like him.

Hunter: [Confused and scared.] What...?

[Hunter suddenly begins getting dragged down into the ground.]

Luz: Hunter!

[Luz takes off her jacket and tosses it towards Hunter for him to grab on, but he still gets dragged downwards.]

Luz: No, no, no!

[Luz grabs onto her jacket trying to pull Hunter out, but she gets dragged towards him instead.]

Luz: You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Just... hang on! Just...

[Despite Luz's best efforts, Hunter still gets sucked into the ground along with her jacket. She falls towards the ground and lands on her knees and elbows.]

Inner Belos: I was really expecting him to last longer than the others.

[Luz turns towards Inner Belos angrily, with tears forming in her eyes.]

Luz: I'm gonna tell everyone about the Day of Unity, that you've been lying about the Titan for years!

Inner Belos: Yes, this has gone on longer than I'd have liked. But... no one ever said being a witch hunter was easy.

Luz: [Incredulously.] Witch... hunter? So all this time, people have been mindlessly helping a witch hunter?! How could they be tricked so easily?!

Inner Belos: I wouldn't be so judgmental, if I were you.

[Inner Belos proceeds to summon a picture frame from the ground behind Luz. It then shows the moment when Red Fang tries to burn Philip Wittebane's journal.]

Red Fang: His pretty little words should make pretty good kindling.

[Luz is appalled by what she is seeing and pants heavily, mouth agape.]

Past Luz: That doesn't belong to you.

Luz: No. No, no, no.

[Scene cuts back to the picture frame showing the moment when Luz taught Philip how to use a light glyph.]

Philip: Astounding!

[Scene changes to show the moment when Philip, Luz and Lilith are inside the Titan's head. Philip winces in pain and kneels down, holding onto his knee.]

Past Luz: It's okay, we can help!

[Scene changes to show the moment when the trio are inside the cave.]

Past Luz: I know you want to get home, but nothing is worth hurting people!

[Scene changes to show the moment when Philip summons the Collector after wiping his hand on the mirror he found in the cave.]

Past Philip/Belos: I just need to live long enough to see this through.

[Luz is in complete denial about this.]

Luz: No, no, no! You're Belos! You're just Belos!

[As she speaks, Luz breaks down in tears and grabs onto her hair, then drops to her knees.]

Inner Belos: Please, do me a kindness, and call me by my real name.

Luz: [Weakly.] I... can't.

[Scene cuts to the picture frame showing the moment when Luz and Lilith approach Philip.]

Past Luz: You're Philip Wittebane, aren't you?

[Scene changes to show the moment after Luz taught Philip how to use a light glyph.]

Past Luz: [To Lilith, excitedly.] I can't believe I taught Philip something new!

[Scene changes to show the moment when Luz and Lilith are in front of the double door inside the head of the Titan.]

Past Luz: I'll go talk to Philip.

[Scene changes to show the moment when Luz looks at Philip hesitantly after reading what he wrote in his journal.]

Past Luz: [Hesitantly.] Philip, why did you bring us here?

[As the scene is playing, Luz raises her head and looks up at Inner Belos with a morose expression on her face, blocking the view of the picture frame.]

[Scene cuts back to the living room of the Owl House. Eda uses a dropper to put a drop of liquid into another liquid inside a flask, but the reaction causes an eruption of gas.]

Eda: [Angrily.] Bones, dirt, and muck! I don't have time to fail!

[As she speaks, she frustratedly throws her flask onto the ground and breaks it, then knocks over her book stand. Someone suddenly knocks on the door, grabbing everyone's attention.]

Hooty: Inopportune interruption, eh? [Deepens voice.] I'll handle this.

[Hooty retracts outside. Eda picks up the book stand she just knocked over.]

King: [Hesitantly.] Eda? Tell me it's... gonna be okay.

[Eda doesn't reply and only looks at him with a worried expression.]

Hooty: Eda!

[Eda looks up. Scene cuts to Hooty barging in through the window with a bouquet of flowers inside his mouth.]

Hooty: Special delivery from a secret admirer!

[Hooty puts the flowers inside a glass vase.]

Eda: Hooty, that thing could be booby-trapped. Get it outta here.

[The flowers suddenly start floating and glowing, surprising Hooty. The flowers then wilt, causing the petals to drop and the contents wrapped inside it to dissolve in the vase and create a yellow liquid. Eda picks up the note that comes with the flowers and reads it.]

Eda: [Gasps.] It's the teleportation potion into the mindscape! But who would...

[Eda walks over to the window and looks outside, in time to see someone disappear behind a rock.]

King: Figure it out later. Now we can save Luz.

Eda: Hold up. [Reads the note.] It says it still needs a power source. And a big one.

[King thinks for a bit, then runs to grab Amity's glove and offers it to Eda.]

King: Use this!

Eda: But... that's the last of Luz's Titan Blood. She needs it to get back home!

King: She'll never get home if she doesn't get back here!

[Eda grabs the glove from King's hand and stares at it hesitantly.]

[Scene cuts back inside Belos' mindscape. Luz backs up from Inner Belos and trips over, not knowing that she has dropped her walkie-talkie. Just then, Eda's voice rings out from the walkie-talkie.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Kid, you there? We're getting you two out.

Inner Belos: It does feel good to hear another human say that name. I had to change it when Philip was run out of too many towns.

[As he speaks, he slowly walks towards Luz who backs up with a frightened expression on her face. She then accidentally falls backwards and rolls down a slope.]

Inner Belos: I told you once before, Luzura.

[Luz stands up as Inner Belos approaches her.]

Inner Belos: Perhaps... [Morphs into Philip.]

Inner Philip: ...we were destined to meet. [walks away]

Luz: And what about Hunter? What's a grimwalker?

[Philip morphs back into Inner Belos.]

Inner Belos: He's... a better version of an old friend. But, thanks to you, I'll have to make another one.

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] She's not answering! Luz? Luz!

Luz: But... why? Why go through all this?

Inner Belos: [Grabs a Golden Guard mask and holds it triumphantly.] I'll do anything to save humanity from evil.

Luz: [Slowly shakes her head.] No.

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Luz, we're gonna start the countdown. Are you ready?

Luz: You're evil.

Inner Belos: Can't reason with crazy.

[He throws his arm, which has morphed into a blade, towards Luz. She covers herself with her arms and screams in fright, when suddenly, a barricade of vines and an ice pillar shield her and block Inner Belos' attack. When Luz opens her eyes, she is shocked to find the barricade, and the arm-blade has barely passed above her head. Scene then pans to Hunter, who is revealed to have summoned the vines and ice pillars and is grabbing onto a thorn.]

Hunter: Luz!

[Hunter turns around with one hand grabbing onto the thorn along with Eda's letterman jacket, and the other one holding onto some glyphs, with a few of them falling to the ground.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Five...

[Luz grabs a fire glyph from the floor as she and Hunter run towards the walkie-talkie.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Four...

[Luz summons a whirlwind of fire from the fire glyph to create a hole in the barricade which she and Hunter pass through.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Three...

[The whirlwind of fire damages and destroys Inner Belos' arm-pickaxe as he retracts his arm in pain. Luz and Hunter run past him.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] Two...

[Hunter and Inner Belos stare at each other for the last time as Hunter is pulled away by Luz.]

Eda: [From the walkie-talkie.] One!

[Luz and Hunter reach the walkie-talkie as Luz makes a dive for it.]

Luz: Eda, now, please, now!

[A burst of light envelopes Luz and Hunter. Scene cuts to outside the Owl House. The ground rumbles and multiple beams of light flashes through the gaps of the barricaded windows. Scene cuts to the living room as Luz and Hunter emerge in a puff of smoke. Cut to King, Eda, Flapjack and Hooty looking down at them as King and Hooty attempt to approach the duo.]

Eda: [Blocks King and Hooty.] Don't crowd them. [To Luz and Hunter.] Are you two okay?

[Luz sits up and gives the gang a blank stare. As Hunter sits up, Flapjack immediately flies to him, pecks his head and chirps repeatedly.]

Hunter: [Gasps.] He knows. He... he knows we were in there. I can't... I can't go back!

[Hunter starts panicking and hyperventilating.]

Eda: [Alarmed.] Kid, breathe.

[She offers her hand to Hunter, but he fearfully backs away. He then looks down at his cloak and immediately takes if off, throwing it to the ground. Scene cuts to outside the house. The door is burst open as Hunter runs away tearfully. Luz attempts to chase after him but then stops.]

Luz: Hunter!

[Flapjack chirps and flies after him. King, Eda and Hooty then come out of the house, looking worried.]

King: What the heck happened in there?

Eda: Luz, what did you see?

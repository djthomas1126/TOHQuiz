King: Uh, feelin' okay, Luz?

Luz: [Writing on a whiteboard.] I feel great! Today's gonna be a productive day of problem solving. [She grabs a scroll of a list, then shows it to Eda.] Look!

Eda: [Reading the list.] "Successfully build a portal to the Human Realm"? "Learn every glyph combination"? "Figure out what Belos is planning and show him what for"?

Luz: [Digs through papers.] Look. I've already learned a new combo. Excuse me, Francois. I call it the safety hover!

[She grabs Francois from King and sticks a glyph combo onto its chest. She then throws it in the air, and it floats right before it hits the ground.]

King: Ooh! That'll work great when birds try to fly away with me.

Luz: And I'm already on my way to building a second door.

[Cut to Hooty trying to stabilize a wooden door taped to him, with a broom, a cinderblock, and a hammer near it. Hooty then sneezes, causing everything to come crashing down.]

Hooty: Achoo! Ow.

Luz: Uh, it's a work in progress. But look at this!

[Luz grabs a Scroll out of her pocket.]

Eda: Did you steal my Penstagram?

Luz: I borrowed it because I've got a castle insider getting info on Belos. Willow gave me Hunter's contact. Hehehe.

[Luz starts texting Hunter under his username, RULERZREACHF4N.]

Luz: [From text.] Are you good now?

Luz: [From text.] Is Belos evil?? You can tell me!

Luz: [From text.] Also hi!

Luz: [From text.] It's Luz!

Luz: [From text.] [Bat emoji, lighting emoji, flower emoji, plant emoji, and rainbow emoji.]

Hunter: [From text.] LEAVE.ME ALONE

[Hunter sends a picture of Flapjack sleeping on his robe.]

Hunter: [From text.] sORry.wrong.person .,.

Eda: Hmm. You're avoiding something. Spill it.

Luz: I am not! Maybe I am. [Lets Eda take her scroll back and sits.] Okay, I definitely am.

[King and Eda surround her, Eda placing her old letterman jacket around Luz.]

Luz: Every year, me and Mom have this little ritual we do. It's nothing big. I just miss her. That's all.

King: What you need is a healthy distraction from your problems. Like breakfast!

Luz: Yeah. Okay. I could go for a griffin egg.

Eda: Well, let us know if you need anything, okay?

Luz: I'll meet you guys in the kitchen.

[Eda and King walk off.]

Luz: [Inhales, then sighs.]

[Amity walks in the Owl House.]

Amity: Luz! I have a problem, and it could distract us all day!

Luz: [Gasps.] Tell me all about it and don't spare a single detail!

[Cut to an exterior shot of the Blight Manor.]

Amity: Dad, look! It's the Bonesborough Brawl tonight. And since I'm finally old enough to participate, I- I was thinking-

[Alador grabs a book made by Darius titled "Abomination Creation" and looks at it with disgust.]

Alador: Ugh.

Amity: Dad!

Alador: Ah, Mittens! Didn't see you there.

Amity: Clearly. So do you think you'll be able to take me to the Brawl tonight?

Alador: No. Uh, tonight they're holding the Emperor's Coven tryouts in town. Your mother already signed you up, and I've prepared a chaperone to make sure you get there safely.

[Alador throws the book to a nearby Abomaton, then the Abomaton slices the book in half and picks Amity up.]

Amity: Aah!

[An alarm from the Abomaton sets off, then Alador turns it off with a remote.]

Amity: You mean to make sure I get there. Dad... I don't want to go to coven tryouts. I wanna enter the Brawl, and maybe win the champion belt. Like you did.

Alador: I goofed off a lot back then. But you have a bright future and shouldn't waste it on that nonsense.

Amity: Uh, but-

Alador: You're welcome.

[The Abomaton walks off while holding Amity.]

[Cut to the Owl House.]

Amity: I don't even want to join a coven anymore. And this thing is so embarrassing, I even tried disguising it.

Luz: Yeah. I actually think Eda has the same outfit.

[Luz stares at the Abomaton's outfit and touches it.]

Amity: The Bonesborough Brawl is the one cool thing my dad did before joining the Abomination Coven. It would've been nice to share something with him.

[Cut to a close-up shot of a picture Amity is holding. It's a picture of her dad as a teenager holding the brawler's belt. Below the stage, some of the people among the audience include: Warden Wrath, Odalia, and Darius, who is booing. Eda and Raine are in the background goofing off together. Amity leans into Luz's shoulder, depressed.]

Luz: Well, hey, I'm here to help... you ditch the tryouts and enter the Brawl!

Amity: What?!

Luz: Come on. You should know I always go for the chaotic route.

[Luz winks at Amity, making her look away blushing.]

Luz: And if you win, maybe you can use it as a chance to tell your dad that you don't want to join a coven anymore.

[Eda and King appear at the doorway to the living room.]

Eda: Did somebody say Bonesborough Brawl? I used to love going to those. Your pops was great in duels. Plus, if you go, you can get that ugly thing out of my house.

Amity: Hmm. You know what? I'll give it a shot.

[Amity circles a spell to make her voice change into her dad's voice.]

Amity: [In Alador's voice.] Abomination, fetch me, a, uh, rare and- and difficult to find emerald dagger from the Night Market!

[The Abomaton leaves the Owl House.]

Eda: That'll keep him busy.

Amity: But my dad can't find out that I ditched tryouts. Not until I win that belt.

Luz: Don't worry. I got you, boo.

[Cut to the forest. Edric and Emira appear.]

Edric and Emira: Hey, Mittens!

[Amity is annoyed, and Luz chuckles while keeping her calm.]

Emira: We're proud of you, sis.

Edric: Yeah, you're becoming more of a delinquent every day.

Emira: All right, Ed. Hand over your Concealment Stone.

Edric: Like I need one of those.

[Emira grabs Edric and pulls him over.]

Edric: Hey!

Emira: Don't play games, Ed. I saw you take one this morning.

Edric: Well you saw wrong!

Amity: [To Luz.] This won't take long.

[Edric and Emira are fighting to get Edric's concealment stone.]

Edric: Wait.. What's that supposed to mean?

[Emira rolls Edric's sleeve, finding his concealment stone on his wrist.]

Emira: Found it!

[Emira takes Edric's concealment stone, then Edric's look suddenly changes. He's wearing a t-shirt, sweatpants, glasses, with his hair pulled back with a headband, and his little uneven moustache growing out.]

Edric: [Grunts.]

Emira: Here's mine too for a little extra flair.

[Emira takes off her concealment stone, then her look also changes. Her face is covered in acne growing out, her beauty mark is gone and her hair is messy.]

[Amity grabs the stones and starts to combine them together. Her whole look suddenly changes within a poof too. She's wearing an abomination-themed dress, boots, golden earrings and pink shades, and her hair is tied up in a bun.]

Amity: [Gasps.] Not bad.

[Luz runs over to Amity, then starts to hug and spin her around.]

Luz: Ooh, so pretty!

[Luz and Amity blush. Both Amity and Emira giggle.]

[Cut to Eda and King watching Luz, Amity, Emira, and Edric.]

King: Hey, Eda!

[Cut to a close-up shot of Warden Wrath fixing his Champ belt.]

King: Maybe we can find out what Belos is planning.

Eda: And why Raine was acting weird at the parade.

[King hides in Eda's hair. Eda walks over to Wrath to have a talk with him.]

Eda: Boo!

Wrath: [Yelps.] Oh, it's you.

King: [Pops out of Eda's hair.] And me!

Eda: Been training since my student humiliated you in battle? Hmm. Twice?

[Wrath is about to attack Eda.]

Eda: All right. Chill out, button eyes. Just answer me this: Heard any good castle gossip lately? Maybe something about the Day of Unity?

Wrath: [Chuckles.] I see. So you finally need something from me, don't you, Owl Lady? But why should I help you?

[Eda grabs Wrath.]

Wrath: Oh!

Eda: After chopping off my head...

King: Stealing my crown...

Eda: ...and imprisoning my student/child, I think you owe me.

[Eda's arm turns into her harpy beast mode threatening Wrath. Wrath snaps his fingers, then a couple of Demon Hunters working security appear.]

Security: Sorry, Owl Lady. No fighting outside the ring.

Eda: Okay, okay. Watch the goods.

King: Whoa, you gave up pretty easy.

Eda: Don't worry, King.

[Eda grabs a Potions Book from her hair and opens a page with the recipe to make Blabber Serum.]

Eda: I have a plan.

Announcer: Witches and demons, welcome to the Bonesborough Brawl!

[Audience cheers.]

Announcer: You know the rules. Contestants will fight one-on-one. Not for honor, not for glory, but for the ultimate bragging rights as the toughest dueler on the Isles!

[Audience cheers.]

Announcer: Last one standing will get the chance to snag the coveted Brawler's Belt from our reigning champion, Warden Wrath!

[Wrath gets in the arena, and starts flexing his belt.]

Announcer: For our first round, we have Scab the All-Knowing...

[Scab the All-Knowing gets to the arena.]

Announcer: ...versus The Mighty Mittens!

[Amity gets to the arena by riding an abomination to the arena.]

[Amity waves at Luz, Edric, and Emira. They wave back at her, and Luz blows Amity kisses.]

Announcer: Now let the brawl begin!

[Scab jumps and takes off. They then start to blast a ray from their orb to Amity. Amity blocks it by using her abomination.]

[Amity transforms her abomination, then launches it behind Scab and punches them from behind.]

[Cut to Luz closing her eyes to not see Amity's abomination punching Scab.]

Luz: [Inner-dialogue.] Wow! Amity's got this in the bag. Guess I, uh, don't need to do much. I can just sit back and think about things.

[Luz's phone starts ringing again, reminding her about the event. Edric and Emira emerge from Luz's back.]

Emira: Hey, Luz.

Edric: Ooh, what's that?

[Luz stares at her phone for a while, then ignores the event reminder again.]

Emira: You okay?

Luz: Yeah! Uh, yeah, I'm fine. 'Cause I just remembered the other part of the plan. Amity's gonna kick butt, like, for sure, but if I was fighting, too, she could get the belt faster. So, I'm also gonna sign up for the Bonesborough Brawl!

[In the background, Scab gets thrown with Amity's abomination and crashes.]

[Cut to the woods near the arena, where the Blights watch Luz stretch.]

Amity: Wait, how is this supposed to help me?

Luz: Think of it like, tag teaming tournament! If I'm taking out contestants too, you have less people to worry about. More chances to win that belt!

Amity: Is everything okay? Eda told me it's a special day for you.

Luz: She did? I mean, i- it's nothing for you to worry about. Not even worth talking about. Really, I- I just wanna help you. Besides, can't let you have all the fun, Blight.

[Amity blushes.]

Amity: Just don't get hurt, okay?

Luz: Emira, do you know any healing spells?

Emira: I'm on it.

Edric: Ooh, I can help too. I can make Batric sing for moral support.

[Edric circles in the air to make a spell, but fails.]

Edric: Ah, sorry. New spell. Let me try again.

[Edric circles in the air, and fails again.]

Emira: It's okay, Ed. Maybe you can just cheer from the sidelines?

Edric: Yeah, okay. Go get 'em, Mittens!

[Emira, Amity, and Luz walk away. Edric slumps sadly and walks into the forest.]

Edric: Man, I can't get anything right.

[Edric and Batric notice something on the ground. Batric chirps, then flies away. It's revealed to be goreberries. Edric walks over, and tries to touch them, but a voice from the rustling bushes interrupts him.]

King: Hey, sweatpants! Scram! [He and Eda burst out of the bush.]

Eda: You'll scare away the Skin Badgers! We need their dandruff.

Edric: Oh! I thought Skin Badgers ate shushrooms, not goreberries. Also, they're strong, so you'll need a fortified rope. [He traces a spell circle in the air, then touches the rope, which turns gold. King and Eda look at each other as Edric stands up.] Sorry. I'm probably messing stuff up. Just forget I said anything.

[Edric starts to walk away, but Eda calls out to him.]

Eda: Wait! You know beast keeping magic?

Edric: A little. It's just a hobby though. Probably not anything good. [Walks away.]

[Eda and King look stunned, then smile at each other; Eda runs after Edric.]

Eda: Hey! Blight Brother!

Edric: [Stops walking.] Edric.

Eda: Nah. Too close to Eda. Here's the deal. [King arrives and hops onto Eda's shoulder.] I'm trying to make a blabber serum. I need to get certain information out of a certain demon. But, without magic, I'm having trouble getting some of these more lively ingredients. Your beast keeping know-how could really help.

Edric: You think I could help? [Looks down and frowns, but stops and smiles.] Okay, I'll do it!

Eda: Dang! I didn't even have to offer to pay.

Edric: Wait, what?

Eda: [Pulls Edric away.] Let's get started!

[Back to the Bonesborough Brawl.]

Announcer: Let's keep the brawl going! In one corner, [Points to the right.] we have... the Flexicutioner! [The Flexicutioner arrives with a loud thud.] And in the other, a last minute entry...

[An ice pillar grows, launching Luz from it. She then flips in the air and uses a plant glyph to grow vines that wrap around her and shield her from falling, which meets the floor with a loud thud. The vines unwrap around Luz as she raises her arms as if achieving victory.]

Announcer: ...the Spellraiser!

[Below the stage, Amity is shocked and blushes while Emira cheers for Luz. Luz and the Flexicutioner approach the middle.]

Announcer: Let the brawl... begin!

[The Flexicutioner speeds off, leaving a gap from where he just stood, and launches towards Luz, preparing to attack her with his axe, but Luz dodges. She continues to escape his attacks until the Flexicutioner hits the ground with his axe, blowing Luz away who is about to fall, but slows her falling when she grabs a glyph from her pockets and slaps it on herself, which slows her landing once she is in near contact with the ground, and falls down. The Flexicutioner once more prepares to attack her with his axe, but Luz taps an invisibility glyph in her hand, making her go invisible and confusing the Flexicutioner. Unbeknownst to him, Luz reappears behind him. She then slaps a fire glyph on his back, which causes him to blast off from the arena and crash into a nearby hill. The announcer then comes over and raises Luz's hand, declaring that she has won the match.]

[Cut to a skin badger noticing a flower nearby and runs up to chew on it. The flower then transforms into a cover and traps it inside. Eda plucks off a hair from atop the skin badger's head and crosses off "SKIN BADGER HAIR" from the list.]

[Meanwhile, back at the venue, Amity faces against the Book Forger from "Sense and Insensitivity". They rush towards each other and attempt to push each other back, creating a power force so strong which causes both of them to fly backwards. The Book Forger summons a large rock from the ground and launches it at Amity. She immediately forms a shield with abomination goo, which successfully blocks the incoming stone, but the force of impact is still strong enough to send her flying backwards. She hits the ground and rolls over multiple times, but eventually manages to sit up. She then summons some abomination goo, wraps it around the Book Forger's foot, and throws him off the stage. Below the stage, Emira is busy trying to cure an injury on Luz's knee with Healing magic. The Book Forger smashes into a pile of dirt next to them and then falls face down onto the ground. The audience cheers.]

[Cut to Batric walking sideways on the ground when it hears something and looks up. Somewhere above, a Fairy notices Batric and rushes towards it. However, Batric turns out to be an illusion. Two ropes then appear and tie up the Fairy, causing her to fall to the ground. She starts crying and screeching. Eda crosses off "FAIRY SPIT" on her list.]

[Back at the venue, Luz finds herself facing down an old goat demon. The demon smashes her walking cane into her knee, splitting it in half. She then starts shrieking, forming a battle aura around herself. Luz immediately takes out 2 smoke glyphs from her pocket and smashes them together, creating a large amount of mist. She then escorts the demon out of the mist. The demon pushes her away and tries to walk off on her own, but accidentally falls off the stage instead. The announcer comes, grabs Luz's arm and lifts it up, declaring her the winner. The audience cheers.]

[Cut to some purple liquid boiling in a pot. Scene changes again to show Edric, Eda and King sitting around the pot, with Eda stirring it with a spatula. The pot is heated up with fire.]

Edric: So the Blabber Serum should get your ex to tell you about your other ex? Man, being an adult gets complicated.

Eda: [Angrily.] Warden Wrath is not my- [Exasperated.] King, can you stop telling people that?

[King laughs.]

Eda: Wrath may know why my... friend can't seem to remember me. And it has something to do with the Day of Unity. But, with this, he'll tell me everything I need to know.

[Eda stares at her reflection on the serum and smirks.]

Eda: Dang. [Stands up.] The fire needs to be hotter. Keep stirring while I find more fuel.

Edric: [Salutes.] Ma'am!

[Eda passes over the spatula to Edric and walks away. Edric then sits next to King.]

King: You're enjoying this, aren't you, Blight brother?

Edric: It's just... nice to be taken seriously for once.

King: Yeah. I know what you mean.

[King climbs up Edric's shoulder and watches him stir the pot.]

[Back at the brawl venue, on stage, Warden Wrath is tossing a contestant in between his hands while laughing. Below the stage, Luz is doing some warm-ups while Emira is trying to cure a wound on Amity's knee with Healing magic.]

Luz: Woo! This is a workout! You doin' okay, Amity?

[Luz walks up to the duo and stares down at Amity's wound.]

Amity: Yeah. [Clenches teeth.] This is just a nasty one.

Luz: Ha! Reminds me of the Grudgby match. [Suddenly pushes Emira forward.] Oh! Remember when-

Emira: Hey, Luz! Maybe you can talk after? I need to focus.

Luz: [Steps back.] Oh! Of course, of course. I'll just... [Kneels down.] sit quietly... with my thoughts.

Luz: [Inner-dialogue.] I just need a healthy distraction. Healthy distraction...

[Luz's phone starts buzzing and ringing again, which startles her, causing her to panic]

Luz: [Stands up.] I'm gonna go take a walk.

[Luz walks away from the duo. Amity stares at her with a perplexed expression on her face. Scene cuts to Luz walking towards the entrance. She takes out her phone from her pocket and turns off the reminder.]

Luz: Next time, I am throwing you into the ocean!

[Luz puts her phone back into her pocket and accidentally bumps into something. She steps back and notices that it's the Abomaton Amity sent out earlier, now holding an emerald dagger in its grip.]

Luz: It's you! Geez. Did you actually find an emerald dagger?

[The Abomaton walks forward, going past Luz.]

Luz: Hey! Wait! Amity is so close to winning. Just stay back!

[While talking, Luz runs up to the front of the Abomaton and tries to hold it back, but it keeps advancing forward, which frustrates Luz.]

Luz: Fine! If that's the way you want it...

[Luz takes out an Ice Glyph and slaps on it, taking out an ice bat.]

Luz: Hi-yah!

[Luz swings the bat at the Abomaton's head and hits it. It wobbles and then restores itself. A warning light bulb pops up from atop the Abomaton's head and flashes, along with the sound of an alarm going off. Luz gasps.]

Luz: [Screams and covers her ears.] Get out of my head!

[Luz slams a Plant Glyph into the ground, creating a wood stump below her which pushes her upwards. She then jumps off it and swings at the bulb, breaking it and knocking it onto the ground. After landing, Luz looks up at the Abomaton with a horrified expression.]

Emira: Luz!

[Luz looks back and notices Amity and Emira running up to her. She immediately throws the ice bat aside and turns towards the duo.]

Emira: Is everything okay?

Luz: Hey, guys! Look who I found!

Amity: Ugh. It's back already! You didn't touch it, right? Dad filled this thing with alarms.

Luz: Uh, of... course not.

[Luz and Amity hear growling and look towards it. On the stage, Warden Wrath begins spouting fire. The audience cheers.]

Luz: [Grabs Amity's hand.] Come on, Amity. It's showtime!

[Cut to later on stage.]

Announcer: Now, we're getting close to the end, folks! Will the Warden lose the Champion's Belt?

[Warden Wrath takes off his mask and begins to spout fire while growling. He then tilts his head upwards and spouts an even bigger fire while growling. The audience cheers. Luz taps on Amity's shoulder to get her attention, and imitates Warden Wrath's growl in a funny way, causing Amity to burst out giggling. Luz then giggles together with her. After that, the duo gets ready to fight, with Luz patting Amity on the shoulders.]

Announcer: The Mighty Mittens versus the Warden! Now, let the brawl-

[The ground suddenly shakes, causing the announcer to glance down in shock. Luz almost falls, but manages to grab onto Amity's arm.]

Alador: Stop!

[Alador emerges from the ground wrapped in a layer of Abomination goo.]

Alador: This child forfeits the match.

[Everyone else is shocked.]

Amity: Dad? How did you find us?

[Alador's abomination starts to lower him on the ground and is eventually scooped back into a container attached to his back.]

Alador: Not only did you ditch the coven tryouts, but someone set off your Abomaton's alarm. I just followed its signal. [Hands her the broken alarm.]

[Amity stares at the alarm in shock while Luz nervously looks away.]

Amity: [Feeling betrayed.] Luz, did you... lie to me earlier?

Luz: [Nervously.] I didn't wanna worry you.

Amity: Well, I am worried! You've been acting weird all day and now I'm in trouble! What is going on with you?

Luz: It's nothing, really. Seriously, it- it's nothing!

[Amity is saddened by Luz's refusal to open up and her face turns sorrowful.]

Warden Wrath: Hey!

[Alador, Amity and Luz look towards him.]

Warden Wrath: I'm tired of standing around. I came here to fight! [Launches himself with his hands, which have turned into tentacles.]

[Before he can attack, he is countered by abomination goo summoned by Alador, which eventually encases his body except his face.]

Warden Wrath: No! No! [Breathes fire, but stops when Alador's abomination goo whisks him to the floor.]

Announcer: Oh, well, it looks like the Champion's Belt goes to... [Gets Warden's champion belt and prepares to hand it to Alador.]

Alador: [Turns around and walks away.] I already have one. [To Amity.] Mittens, go round up Edric and Emira. We're leaving.

Amity: But-

Alador: [Serious.] And if we beg, maybe we can sign you up for the next tryout.

[Alador attempts to take Amity's hand, but she angrily slaps it away.]

Amity: [Enraged.] No! I'm not going anywhere with you. [Summons an invisibility glyph from Luz's pocket.] Either of you. [Inhales and runs away vanishing.]

Luz: Amity! [Runs after her, leaving Alador.]

[Behind Alador, King and Edric peek out from a tree in the distance.]

King: Aw, weak. Your dad's here.

Edric: But look! Wrath's tied up. This is the perfect chance to give him the serum!

King: But it isn't ready! [Edric leaves.] Hey!

[Back to their camping spot, Edric unties a sack and scrambles through the things inside.]

Edric: No, not this one. Oh! [Pulls out a jar of Fire Bee honey and runs to the cauldron.]

King: What are you doing?

Edric: [Opens the jar lid.] If the Blabber Serum needs more heat to finish, then this should do just the trick. [Pours a drop of honey into the cauldron.]

[The potion emits a flash of light and it turns green and bubbly.]

Edric: You find Ms. Eda. I'll head over to Wrath. [King nods and runs off; Edric carries the cauldron with a spell.]

[Meanwhile, Luz tries to find Amity with no luck, only to discover her glasses lying near her feet. She walks over as the background changes to the tree she and Amity grew at Grom together. Upon seeing Amity, she walks closer.]

Luz: Can I, uh, sit here?

[Amity merely nods, and she sits down beside her.]

Amity: I've always wanted to enter this Brawl. I thought it would be fun to bring home the belt. And I thought I could understand my dad better. But then you joined the competition. And then you tried to mess with that Abomaton on your own. And then you lied about it.

[Luz looks away guiltily.]

Amity: You've been acting strange all day. Does it have something to do with the Human Realm?

Luz: Oh, okay, okay. I don't talk about this cause it happened like, a long time ago, and it's like totally not an issue anymore but, uh...

[Luz hands her phone to Amity, who presses the reminder she had been avoiding all day. It says "Anniversary at Gravesfield Graveyard. When: 5:00."]

Luz: Today's the anniversary of my dad passing away. That's, not an excuse for what I did. Like I said it happened a while ago so I, uh...

[Amity looks at her in shock.]

Luz: ...Didn't want to bring it up.

[Amity scrolls through the photos Luz has with her parents, eventually the later ones with only her and her mom when she was younger.]

Luz: He always brought us flowers on our birthdays, so, after he passed away, we started picking flowers for each other. And then we'd visit his grave, and me and my mom would spend the day together. It's nice. But, this year, I-I'm not with her, and... I don't have any flowers. And when you told me about the problem with your dad, I don't know. [Starts to tear up.] Maybe I was jealous or, just, needed a distraction. [She bows her head.] I was dumb. I'm sorry.

[Amity is about to console Luz when they both heard sounds of people screaming. They look towards the source of sound and gasp. Amity immediately takes off, but Luz collapses after standing and her legs are wobbly; Amity looks back at her.]

Luz: [Chuckles.] Whoops, got a case of the ole jelly legs. I'll catch up.

[Amity looks towards the noise and back at Luz.]

Amity: [Blushing and upset.] I don't know what rituals you have in the Human Realm, but, I'll help you pick some flowers, and we can do something here!

[Amity leaves as Luz looks at her, also blushing.]

[Back in the arena, a woman screams as she points to something offscreen as she and other people run away; Eda arrives with King on her shoulder.]

Eda: What the heck happened?

Edric: I-I added fire bee honey to the blabber serum!

Eda: You changed the recipe? [Pulls Edric away as Wrath, now a roaring monster, causes chaos in the arena.]

[Eda unleashes her harpy form and roars at Wrath.]

Harpy Eda: [Flies over Wrath.] Hey, Wrath! You still in there, buddy? [She attacks him, but he blows her away into the forest.]

[Just then, Amity's Abomaton gets a hold of Wrath, revealed to be controlled by Alador; the Abomaton is knocked away as Alador summons another abomination.]

Emira: [Runs over.] Edric! [Amity arrives.]

Amity: Dad! I got your back! What?

[She attempts to summon an abomination, but Alador uses some goo to drop her back with Edric, Emira and King, knocking her hair loose.]

Emira: [Displeased.] What the heck, Dad!?

Edric: Boo! [Alador continues to hold off Wrath.]

Amity: [Stands up angrily.] Oh, he just doesn't get it! [Harpy Eda lands nearby.] Are you guys doing okay?

Harpy Eda: For now, but nothing phases this guy, and we have to turn him back to normal.

Edric: [Stands up.] Well, if the heat from the fire bee honey caused the potion to mutate, then maybe something cold would reverse it?

Harpy Eda: We don't have time for a new potion!

Luz: [Offscreen.] You don't need one. [Everyone looks at her; Amity gasps.] I can handle this. Eda, can you give me a lift?

Harpy Eda: You got it, kiddo. [Flies off.]

Luz: [Walks over to Amity.] Thank you for listening. [Holds Amity's hand.] I can't wait to pick flowers with you. [She walks back and fans some glyphs in her hand, and her other hand gets caught by Harpy Eda.]

[Alador, meanwhile, is having trouble controlling the Abomaton, which is cruelly being smashed by the monster Wrath. The Abomaton gets thrown off and is smashed by Wrath's jelly hand. Just then, another abomination appears and helps the Abomaton, to Alador's shock, the abomination is revealed to have been summoned by Amity. Alador once again prepares to send her off, but she stops him.]

Amity: I'm making my own choices from now on.

Alador: But-

Amity: You're welcome. [Divides her spell circle into two.]

Edric: Hold him down!

[Both Alador and Amity nod to each other, then dispel their circles and create another larger one, combining their abominations, which hold Wrath in place. Alador looks at Amity, still focused, and he looks back proudly. Harpy Eda and Luz arrive; Luz throws the glyphs in mid-air as Harpy Eda turns around and they both activate the glyphs, creating large amounts of snow that encase Wrath as the Blights' abomination releases him. Everyone comes back to where Alador and Amity are.]

Alador: Edalyn.

Harpy Eda: Alador.

Alador: [Eyeing Harpy Eda.] Were you always able to do that? [Harpy Eda turns back into her normal form in a puff of smoke.]

Eda: Don't you have family stuff to clear up? Also, I heard about the factory incident with Luz. I've got my eyes on you, Blight. [Pokes Alador's goggles, walks away, and then pulls Wrath out of the snow.] What's going on at the castle? What's really gonna happen on the Day of Unity? Have Raine's memories been altered?

Warden Wrath: I don't know! I don't know. I actually got demoted for stealing my coworker's lunches. I just wanted to feel in control again, you know? [Eda growls angrily and her arm turns into a claw.] Okay, okay, okay. I don't know about Raine, but I have heard some things. The Day of Unity is supposedly going to unite us with the Titan, but some of us don't think this "new world" would be very inviting to magickind. [Eda's claw arm turns back to normal.] Wild or not. [Eda pushes him back into the snow.]

Eda: Hmm...

Edric: [Runs over.] Ms. Eda! I am so, so sorry. I messed everything up.

Eda: Are you kidding? Instead of making a blabber serum, you made a horrifying transformation serum! [She scrapes some snow off to reveal Wrath.]

Warden Wrath: I think I'm gonna puke! [Proceeds to puke.]

Eda: Well, the side effects aren't pretty, but I can sell this. [Gets something from her hair.] Illusions, beastkeeping, and potion magic? [King crawls up to Eda's shoulder.] Keep it up, kid. You got a future in wild magic.

[Eda throws Edric a "Bad Girl Coven" t-shirt.]

Edric: Thanks, Ms.--

Emira: [Runs in front of Edric.] I want a t-shirt too!

[Scene slowly pans to Alador and Amity.]

Alador: What? You don't want to join the Emperor's Coven anymore? But that's- that's always been your dream.

Amity: No, that's always been Mom's dream. And you just went along with it. [Starts to blush.] I bet you didn't even know I was dating Luz!

Alador: Edalyn's kid?

Amity: See? You don't talk to us anymore! You're too busy making these monsters for the Emperor, and Mom's been too busy trying to dye my hair green.

Alador: I... I like your new hair color. It's abomination-colored.

Amity: Finally someone gets it. Can you tell Mom that?

Alador: I'll talk to her. [He tries to reach out for a hug, but Amity instead shakes his hand.]

Amity: It's a start.

[Back at the Grom tree, Amity walks over to find Luz on a cliff picking flowers, most of which are dead. She sits next to her.]

Amity: Find any good ones?

Luz: No, not really.

Amity: Let me try.

[She tries to draw a plant glyph on the soil, but when she activates it, all that comes out is an ugly vine.]

Amity: [Offscreen.] Ugh. [Cont.] How do you get it to do what you want?

Luz: You gotta know what you need. [Starts drawing a plant glyph on the soil.] I can't believe I didn't try this first. My head's really on backwards today.

[Her glyph is more well-drawn and upon activating it, pretty flowers spring from it. She picks them and turns to Amity.]

Luz: Now what?

[Amity summons abomination goo from the jar in her pocket, and it morphs into a balloon, which she hands to Luz. Luz ties the flowers to the balloon and after closing her eyes for a while, she lets it float away.]

Amity: Do you think they'll reach the Human Realm?

Luz: Probably doesn't work that way, but... it's a nice thought, right?

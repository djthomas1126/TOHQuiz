King: [voice] Luz, I'm so happy I had you as a big sister.

[Cut to Luz, Amity, Willow, Gus and Hunter getting launched from the Demon Realm to the abandoned house the Human Realm, all landing on their backs.]

Luz: No! [Runs back towards the door.] King!

[She attempts to reach the portal, but the door closes on her just as she reaches it. She opens it, hoping the portal would activate again, only to find the empty room of the house in front of her. She tries it two more times unsuccessfully, as the others look on in shock. Luz turns around, just as Gus begins to break down crying. Meanwhile, inside the Noceda residence, Camila is in the kitchen cooking soup for a hungry Vee while reading a news article about Anne Boonchuy. Both then suddenly hear a knock on the door. Camila opens it, and gasps in shock to find the five teens looking disheveled out in the rain, as Luz looks up at her.]

Luz: Hey, Mom. I'm back. [Starts tearing up.]

[Camila looks at her daughter and gives her a warm embrace, with both shown crying.]

[Cut to inside the house. Camila is washing the dishes. Gus helps her by using magic and an awkward Amity gives her a cup of wrongly prepared tea, who then in turn receives a pat on the shoulder. Cut to the bathroom. Luz gets out a box of bandages that have cartoon mascots resembling Eda, King, and Hooty, which makes her sad. Hunter then approaches her.]

Hunter: Hey. Thanks for not telling them that I'm a...

Luz: [opening the box of bandages] A grimwalker?

Hunter: Shhhh, don't say it so loud! Uh... what about you? How've you been since, uh...?

Luz: Since we were in Belos' mind? Since I found out I helped him meet The Collector? Oh my gosh, Hunter. [starts tearing up again] They're all gonna hate me.

Hunter: What? Psssh! [Luz wipes away her tears and slightly smiles] No, of course they won't. They won't hate you any more than me when they find out that... [starts panicking] I might be a clone of... someone who was a... witch hunter... with... Belos...

[Cut to the dining room. Willow and Amity are seated at the table, looking despondent. Cut back to Luz and Hunter.]

Luz: We'll tell them. When we're ready.

[Hunter nods. Luz and Hunter join the others in the dining room, Luz putting a bandage on Amity's hand.]

Camila: Okay, so in the Demon Realm, you fought the evil Emperor Belos who turned into a monster...

Gus: Well, he started out human.

Camila: Right, but he was defeated by a newer, smaller bad guy?

Willow: The Collector. We don't know what he is or how Belos found him.

Luz: [panicked] Who knows if we'll ever figure that out?! But they're creating a lot of chaos.

Amity: We have to do whatever it takes to get back.

Camila: And you will. But for now, you should all rest. You're all safe here.

[Cut to outside the house. The lights turn off when the sludge from Belos floats by.]

[Cut to the basement. Gus and Hunter are settling in. Gus opens up an umbrella.]

Gus: Whoa! [laughs] Hunter, look at all this awesome human stuff! [He takes out some bubble wrap and begins to pop it, but when it rolls out, a snow globe falls to the floor and breaks.] Whoops.

Hunter: I think it's just "stuff" here.

[Camila comes in with some bedsheets.]

Camila: It's not much, but I hope you two will be comfortable.

Gus: We will, Luz's Mom!

Hunter: [clears throat and walks up to her on his knees and bows] Thank you for providing us with shelter, ma'am.

Camila: [backing away] Please never do that again. And you can call me "Camila". [winks] Buenas noches. ["Good night."]

[Camila walks up the stairs and Gus discovered he has popped every bubble.]

Gus: [gasps] Aw.

[Cut to Luz's room. Camila creaks open the door to peer in. Vee shows Willow and Amity an alarm clock.]

Vee: In the morning, instead of screaming, it'll do this! [activates the alarm]

[Willow and Amity gasp in shock.]

Amity: Don't worry, Vee!

Willow: We'll keep you safe!

[Willow destroys the alarm with her plant magic.]

Willow: Good work! It's dead! [She and Amity bump elbows.]

Vee: [slightly disappointed] Uh... thanks. [She looks down at the floor where the hole created by Willow's vine is.]

Camila: [closing the door with a shocked face] I'll figure that out later.

[Camila looks down the hallway and sees Luz looking sadly at the photo of her and her family.]

Luz: Mamá, I... I know I shouldn't have left. I never meant to lie, but I had to stay, and... and it wasn't because I... [gets cut off by Camila hugging her]

Camila: Hey. Hey. We'll have time to talk later. I'm just so happy you're home.

Luz: Yeah. I'm home. [Looks at Willow and Amity inside her room, the latter comforting the former as she undoes her braids.] But they're not.

[A montage occurs of time passing with events: the kids goes back to the old house, begin refurbishing it and setting up portal schematics. Luz puts together a coming out video and shows it to her mother, who happily accepts her and Amity's relationship. Luz and her friends get new clothes while Vee chooses a new human form to take. Hunter has a mental breakdown due to his hair growing out enough to remind him of Belos and he attempts to hastily cut it, which gets Willow's attention and she does it for him, much to his appreciation. When the gang attempt to test a portal, it briefly breaches the In Between Realm before exploding, which depresses Luz. Hunter and the Hexisidians give Camila some Demon Realm cuisine much to Luz and Camila's shock and disgust. Luz and Vee show everyone the non-boiling rain with Willow taking an interest in photography. Luz becomes homesick for the Boiling Isles and her surrogate family with her egg showing no signs of hatching despite her incubating it; she also has to go back to school.]

[Amity, Gus, Hunter, Vee, and Willow are hanging out together in the abandoned shed, which they have remodeled. Willow takes a picture while everyone else looks down at a tablet.]

Amity, Gus, Hunter, and Vee: [Trilling R's]

Gus:[Mumbling] Am I doing this right?

Vee: Tres tristes tigres comen en tres tristes platos de trigo.

Tablet: Perfecto! You're our top student!

Amity: Hmm. I was the top student once.

[Flapjack begins pecking at the table.]

Gus: He's still doing that, huh?

Hunter: He won't tell me what he's looking for.

[Camila enters the shack.]

Camila: Hi. Ooh! I like what you've done with the place. No more exposed nails or possum nests. But this still confuses me.

[Camila motions to a painting of Hooty on the door.]

Willow: Yeah. He still confuses us too.

Gus: [Waving] Hola Camila. We're learning Spanish from this scary owl app.

Tablet: Hoot hoot! Practice every day, or I'll appear in your nightmares.

Camila: Oh, okay. Well, I'm going to pick Luz up from school. Pop quiz. ¿Como se dice eso en español? (How do you say that in Spanish?)

Hunter: Oh, oh! Uh...[inhales and tries to speak Spanish but fails]

Vee: Voy a recoger a Luz de la escuela. (I am going to pick up Luz from school.)

Camila: Muy bueno! Keep it up.

[Camila leaves the shack.]

Camila: Ooh. [sighs] I never expected to be a mother of six.

[Back in the shed, Hunter sits down next to Gus as everyone resumes learning Spanish from the tablet. Flapjack is seen still pecking on the floor.]

Tablet: Taxi.

Willow, Gus, Hunter, and Vee: Taxi!

Tablet: El gato gordo.

Willow, Gus, Hunter, and Vee: El gato gordo!

Amity: [sighs] Maybe we should take a break.

Willow: A siesta.

Gus: Siesta!

Amity: We've been here for months, and we've made no progress on the portal door. We can't expect Camila to take care of us forever.

Gus: In the meantime, we could pull more weight around the kitchen. My mustard ravioli did bring tears to her eyes.

Vee: Those weren't the kind of tears you're thinking of.

Hunter: I can help fixed damaged clothes!

Willow: [holding up a plant monster] I can spruce up the garden!

Plant Monster: [growls at Vee]

Amity: Maybe we need to look elsewhere. There's an entire Human Realm to search. [She flinches when Willow takes a picture of her.]

Willow: But Luz has school most of the week.

Amity: So? Let's explore the town ourselves. After all, Luz went into the Boiling Isles on her own.

Gus: If Eda came here before, maybe there were others. Maybe they left something behind we can use.

Amity: Yes! That's the spirit! Together, there is no challenge that can hold us back.

[Amity trips in a hole Flapjack pecked and faceplants.]

Amity: [groans] Ow.

Gus: It's a sign! We're doomed!

Amity: Come on Flapjack, this isn't funny anymore.

[Once Amity gets her foot free, she sees something in the hole.]

Amity: [gasp] There's something in here.

[Amity holds up a hexagonal box. She opens it and takes out a scroll and unrolls it. All gasp.]

Gus: Hmm. Looks like a map?

Willow: Or a secret code?

[Flapjack twitters on Hunter's shoulder.]

Hunter: Flapjack, is this what you've been looking for? What does it lead to?

Amity: That eye, it kinda looks like the old portal door.

Gus and Willow: [gasp] The portal door! [chanting] Portal door! Portal door! Portal door!

Vee: Let's tell Luz.

Amity: What if it's just another dead end? She already feels responsible for our other failed attempts.

Willow: Then, let's not tell her until we can figure it out. Using our buff brains!

All: Buff brains!

Hunter: [laughs] Yeah!

[Cut to Luz at school during an English class.]

Mr. Sandoval: "Foes vanquished, he trod the shores of his fatherland, family by his side, finally at peace." This epic ends with the homecoming of not just a man, but a hero.

Luz: Hero? Everywhere he went, people ended up suffering.

Mr. Sandoval: It does get bleak, but no one said his mission would be easy. And when you take into account the ripple effects of his actions-

Luz: Who cares about the ripple effects? He was just a pawn in someone else's game. A-and he was never smart enough to realize it. If his friends and family knew about his mission, they'd know that their lives would have never been in danger if it weren't for him. They should hate his guts, and it would have been better if he literally never existed!

[School bell rings. Luz walks by her art class A sign there reads "No taxidermy, no spiders, no snakes, no animal parts, no fireworks," clearly directed at Luz. Her teacher sees her, and gives her a dirty look. Luz opens her locker, which is full of art of Eda and King. Luz sighs and when she closes it, some students are standing next to her. ]

Student 1: Hey! [Luz gets startled.] You're Luz, right?

Luz: Uh...

Student 1: Nice to meet ya. You were right in class. We read about too many crusty old dudes. Give me books about crusty old women!

Luz: I used to know one. I've never seen you two around.

Student 1: We're new, but we've heard all about you.

Student 2: Are you gonna make another crazy costume for Halloween this year?

Student 1: Cause if you are, we're volunteering at the Haunted Hayride.

Student 2: Old Gravesfield is the most haunted place in the state.

Student 1: Yeah, you gotta come. [chuckles]

[Cut to Camila and Luz in their car.]

Camila: Do you think this food is okay? Ah... I wish I knew how to make demon food for your friends. Would they, um, prefer to drink blood?

Luz: Mom.

Camila: Ay, I'm sorry. I'm just saying if we need to find a way, we'll find a way.

Luz: No, look out!

[both gasp]

Adult: Oh, it was so scary. It just came out of nowhere. That deer really spooked us. Will my insurance cover this?

Child: But, Mommy, it wasn't a deer. It was a monster!

[later that night at the Noceda Residence.]

Camila: [distant] Thanks for helping, Gus.

Gus: Anytime. Good night! Whoo! We've got a big day ahead of us, so I'm gonna buenas this noche.

Hunter: Mm-hmm! [gets finger caught in Camila's sewing machine] Ow! [whimpers]

Gus: You good? That sounded painful.

Hunter: [scoffs] I've been training in the Emperor's Coven for as long as I can remember. I think I can handle a little...[cuts finger, winces] ...pain.

Gus: Ooh. That went clean through. [He puts bandage tape over Hunter's finger.]

Hunter: Camila taught me how to use this sewing contraption. Even Darius's stitches have never been this neat. Oh, and look at what I made! [holds up a shirt] These are mystical beasts called wolves, and I love them.

Gus: That looks great. You know, you've been smiling a lot more since we've been here.

Hunter: It's not like I don't want to return! I just need a way to pass the time. That's all.

Gus: No. It's good to see you happy. One of us might as well be. What was it like to be in the Emperor's Coven for so long?

Hunter: I trained a lot. I studied a lot. I wasn't really allowed to be around the other scouts. But weekends were nice. I got to leave the castle for missions.

Gus: Do you miss it?

Hunter: I miss knowing who I'm supposed to be.

Gus: I miss my dad.

Hunter: We'll find a way back. We have to.

Gus: Oh, my Titan. That's a line from this book I found. Cosmic Frontier! It's a story that takes place in the stars.

Hunter: Why would anyone wanna go up there?

Gus: I don't know. Humans like spreading their junk everywhere. But it's a story of people trying to get back home, like us.

Hunter: Uh-huh.

Gus: We got Captain Avery, Security Officer Quando, and a Chief Engineer O'Bailey who's hiding as a clone from the enemy planet.

Hunter: [gasps] What, uh, happens to him?

Gus: I guess you'll have to find out. [opens closet to reveal costumes]

[In the girls' room, Luz is wide awake. She picks up her palisman egg and leaves the room, spilling some of the things on her desk. Amity hears the noise and wakes up; she finds the flyer for the Haunted Hayride and picks it up. Cut to Camila in her bed researching the Demon Realm.]

Camila: They don't hate garlic like vampires, but they weren't entirely against eyeballs when we were watching that zombie movie. Gus said I could get apple blood from the apple butcher, but... [yawns] ...until I find one of those, I'll have to use food coloring.

[As Camila drifts off to sleep, she begins to have flashbacks in the form of a dream]

Young Luz: [gasps] Look what I found!

Children: Gross, don't touch that dead thing. Ew. Gross.

Young Luz: It's not dead. This is the skin of a garter snake. They shed their pajamas as they grow. It means there's a snake near us, and it just got a lot bigger!

Children: Ew! [all scream]

Camila: [laughs] She called them pajamas.

Adults: Ugh. So unhygienic. That girl must've been raised by wolves.

Camila: Hey! Wolves are actually great parents, and-

[Flashforward to a more recent time.]

Young Luz: O happy dagger! Give me death! [groans]

Camila: Huh?

Children: [screaming]

Camila: [laughs] Her dad taught her that one.

Adult 1: [retches] Gross! Now everything smells like lunch meat.

Adult 2: Yeah, she's such a try-hard.

Camila: Oye! What did you just say?

[Camila's chair falls backwards, Camila screams, grunts, and Camila is transported to even more recently, in the principal's office]

Principal: I said, grief can manifest in different ways. Like how Luz has been acting out for attention.

Camila: Losing Manny was difficult for both of us, but Luz has always done things differently.

Principal: Didn't you say you were bullied in high school, Mrs. Noceda?

Camila: Uh, yes, but-

Principal: Luz hasn't made any friends, her grades are inconsistent, and I heard she brought a live snake to school? Take this. It could help her.

Camila: "Reality Check Camp"?

Principal: You don't want Luz to struggle like you did, right?

Luz: Mom?

Camila: [wakes up, gasps, pants] Luz? What time is it?

Luz: Mom? Why aren't you mad at me?

Camila: [sighs] Oh, baby. Come here. I've been terrified, sure. But believe it or not, I do understand what it's like to want to run away.

Luz: I'm so sorry.

Camila: But the point is, you came home, and everything is okay now.

Luz: But it's not. It's my fault everyone's trapped here. A-and I don't even know if King and Eda are okay. I wanted you to meet them so bad. But I keep messing up.

Camila: Hey, everyone makes mistakes. What matters is that you learn from them.

Luz: Can I sleep here tonight?

Camila: [kisses]

Luz: Give the palisman a kiss too.

Camila: [kisses]

[Cut to the next day, where Amity, Gus, Hunter, Vee, and Willow are preparing to leave.]

Amity: All right. Luz is at her mom's vet clinic putting tiny little bandages on "hedgehogs." So today, we're going into town to solve this code.

Gus: Ears.

Vee: Routes.

Willow: Snacks, check.

Hunter: Human disguise, check. Eh?

Willow: Oh, that is a look. [takes a picture of Hunter]

Hunter: [walks between Gus and Vee, the former amazed] According to Cosmic Frontier, this is what the modern human male wears.

Vee: This was written in the '90s about the year 2008.

Hunter: Yeah. Can't wait for that New Year's party.

Gus: And did you get to the last chapter?

Hunter: O'Bailey is still hiding the fact that he's a Duplicant in hyperdisguise. But Captain Avery is figuring it out.

Gus: I think he already knows but-

Hunter: Ah, bup-bup-bup! No, no, no, no, no spoilers!

Amity: Hunter, I don't think the world is ready for the brave fashion choices of the year 2008. Please change.

Willow: [gags Amity] Don't listen to her!

Vee: [taking her human form] Aw, geez, we're gonna miss the bus.

Hunter: Oh, it's okay! I'll catch up. There's a transport worm every half hour.

[The girls nod and leave, Ghost meowing as she joins Amity, and once Gus exits, Willow turns back to close the door.]

Willow: I'm gonna borrow that book when you're done with it. [makes a finger gun and winks]

[As she closes the door, Hunter sports a happy blush as he removes his headphones. Flapjack twitters.]

Hunter: You know, maybe you're right, Flap. [looks at himself in a mirror] Even if I'm not who I'm supposed to be... I like who I am right now.

[Hunter notices something on the table in front of him and touches it. Then, he sees Belos in the mirror reflection.]

Hunter: [gasps]

[Cut to Amity, Gus, Vee, and Willow exploring Gravesfield]

Amity: First stop, The Magic Circle.

[A montage begins. They enter the Magic Circle shop; Gus and Willow look around while Amity and Vee question the cashier.]

Shop Owner: Hey!

[Gus knocks over a barrel as Willow (in a devil costume) pokes a customer with a pitchfork. The kids are chased out, but Willow return to pay for the costume with a snail then leaves again. As they cut through the park, Willow and Gus stop at two familiam-looking statues. The kids all go to the library next, where Amity sees a card catalogue. She expects it to be living, and greets it, bows, and gives it candy which falls to the ground. A child then opens one drawer, and Amity shouts. Embarrassed, she tries to run away and trips and falls on the candy. Then, they head to the giraffe exhibit at the zoo. Gus bows to it, with no response. They all leave cautiously, but Willow takes a photo which scares the giraffe and it opens its mouth to reveal a monstrous inside.]

[all scream]

Gus: I don't blame our ancestors for banishing those guys. Yeesh.

Child: Dad, can we go to the bird hall?

Father: In a minute. How about we eat first?

Children: Yeah!

Vee: [sighs] I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but... I think I know where to go next.

[Cut to them outside the Gravesfield Historical Society. The witchlings excitedly head towards the building, but Willow stops and turns back to see Vee anxiously hugging her middle.]

Willow: You can wait here if it's too scary. Luz told me about that creepy witch-hunter wannabe.

Vee: It's okay. We just faced down a giraffe. I can do this!

[The scene cuts to the inside of the building as Vee kicks the door in, fists raised and screaming.]

Vee: [confused] Huh?

[It isn't Jacob Hopkins she finds; it's her goth friend from Reality Check Summer Camp sporting a new hairstyle and wearing a staff shirt over her outfit. The nameplate on the front desk reads "Masha (they/them)".]

Vee: You're not Jacob.

Masha: We can all thank Goddess for that. He got fired after he started making edits to the exhibits.

[They point to a cardboard cutout of Jacob in his armor with a sign that says "Local Hero - Humanity's Last and Most Handsome Hope". The cutout collapses forward, and cut back shows Vee and Willow are staring at it in distaste.]

Masha: I work part-time now. Say, have we met? [gets close to Vee] Something about you seems familiar.

Vee: [nervous] Uh, no. I'm new in town. I just have one of those faces. J-but just the one. The normal amount of face.

Masha: [laughs] What a coincidence, me too. If you ever need a tour guide, hit me up.

[Masha holds up a pamphlet and Vee takes it, an awestruck blush showing on her cheeks. Amity steps out from behind Vee and presents the puzzle.]

Amity: We're actually here to ask about this old puzzle. Do you know how to decode it?

Masha: Ooh, a rebus. They dug up a bunch of these in Old Gravesfield.

Gus: This is a rebus?

Masha: Yeah. It's like a riddle where pictures and symbols make up a word. Like- Come here. What do you think they were trying to say?

Gus: [pulls his beanie down more] Chop off an ear!

Masha: No. See the H that comes first? Then combine that with the ear and maybe it means "hear" like, to listen. Or, "here" as in a place. Maybe something is waiting somewhere.

[phone rings]

Masha: I'll be right back.

Amity: If this is a portal door then what about these? A-a ribbon, and tanning a hide?

Willow: That ribbon is tied together.

Gus: Next to that hand with a cut.

Willow: You don't think...

Gus: This is leading us to...

Amity: Tie tan's... blood?

Amity, Gus, Willow: [all gasp] Titan's Blood!

Vee: It's like you're reading each others' minds. You must have been friends forever!

Amity: It wasn't always like this.

Willow: These past few months have been weird but look at all the new memories we have now. It's been nice to finally spend some time together.

Amity: Yeah. I can't wait to show everyone at home.

Vee: Maybe the scrapbook could use one more?

Willow: Aw, come here, Vee.

Gus: Everyone say, "Giraffes are still terrifying!"

All: [laughter]

[Vee examines the photo they took, and notices a map behind them.]

Vee: Hmm. Hey. That map of Old Gravesfield looks exactly like this. Do you think it's a map to a stash of Titan's Blood?

Willow: With that, we could actually create a portal.

Amity: I can't wait to tell Luz! And I know just how to surprise her.

[Cut to Luz at Camila's veterinarian clinic.]

Luz: [sighs] What will you be, little palisman? A bird like Owlbert? A cool bug? Maybe an octopus, so we can hold hands? Maybe... maybe you'll never hatch. And I messed up your life too.

Camila: How's the lamp working?

Luz: Just fine.

Camila: Good. I'm ready to lock up.

Luz: [touches a glyph she had drawn, and the glyph begins to smoke.] Huh?

[Cut to Hunter back in the house. Flapjack twitters.]

Hunter: [on edge] Did you know about this? That he was here? I can tell you're hiding something.

[chirps]

Hunter: [sighs] Sorry. I shouldn't take this out on you. I'm just scared.

[vehicle approaches]

[chirps]

Hunter: Don't worry, Flap. If Belos is really here, I'll keep you safe.

[twittering]

Luz: Hunter, what's wrong?

Hunter: Belos.

Luz: [gasps]

[Hunter and Luz stand outside the shed.]

Luz: Are you sure you saw him? I thought The Collector destroyed Belos.

Hunter: Yeah. I'm- I'm sure.

Luz: Hey. We can wait for the others if you-

Hunter: No! We have to take care of this ourselves. [sighs] Titan, I hate this! I was never scared as the Golden Guard.

[Two masks fly by in the wind. One resembles King, the other resembles Hooty.]

Luz: Then how about we bring back some of that masked confidence, huh? [growls]

Hunter: All right, Belos! What's about to happen should be relatively painless, if you just do what we say.

Luz: That's right! So come out with your hands behind your creepy, dumb head!

[whooshes, wind howling, object rattles, both gasp, wardrobe rattling, Luz opens the wardrobe, both gasp, opossum hisses]

Luz: Oh, thank goodness. It's just a little angel.

Hunter: No one's here. I guess it was just in my head.

Luz: Well, can't blame you for being paranoid after everything we've been through.

Hunter: Yeah. You know, I just wanna make sure everyone's safe.

Luz: Same. And that includes you too.

Hunter: What?

Luz: Yeah. Gonna make sure you're safe too, Hunter. You're family now.

Hunter: Oh. [chuckles, begins crying] Ah, this mask is pretty gross now.

[both laugh]

Luz: Let's get back before anyone worries.

Hunter: Yeah. Everything's okay. Belos is gone.

[Luz and Hunter enter the house where Amity, Camila Gus, Willow, and Vee are.]

Hunter: Hey, we're back! [chuckles] And we bought some, uh, cars. [Luz elbows him]

Amity: Luz! We're designing our costumes for the Haunted Hayride.

Gus: Guess what I've got planned? I'm gonna be Captain Avery and you're...

Hunter: [gasps] Chief Engineer O'Bailey?

Camila: [gulps] How do you know about Cosmic Frontier?

Hunter: All the books in your basement.

Camila: Oh! [laughs] Funny how things just show up in basements, right? Without you hiding or putting them there. [laughs] Life sure is full of surprises.

Gus: Cool! Humans freak out just like us.

Willow: It'll be fun. We want to experience your weird human traditions. [puts on vampire teeth and laughs]

Amity: And I thought you and I could take inspiration from... Good Witch Azura The Movie 2: The Betrayanning!

[beeps]

Azura (on T.V.): Hecate! I'll protect you!

Villainous Lucy (on T.V.): Give her over, Azura. It's for your own good.

Azura (on T.V.): Never!

Amity: [holds up a drawing] I could be the Hecate to your Azura. What do you think?

Luz: Oh, wow. Yeah, let's do it! [She pulls Amity into a hug.]

Azura (on T.V.): How could you do it, Villainous Lucy? How could you betray your friends? Now everyone is gone!

Villainous Lucy (on T.V.): It was for the greater good.

Azura (on T.V.): We'll never forgive you. Never!

[Luz sees this and her face falls. Later that night, Luz can't sleep again. She turns to see Amity sleeping and smiles, but it quickly vanishes before she gets out of bed and takes her laptop to the kitchen. Laptop chimes.]

Luz: Dear Diary, all I ever wanted was to be good at something, to be around people who also liked that something. And when I found the Demon Realm, I-I though, "Wow, I found it. I can learn magic. I can be a witch. I-I won't be the dummy in the principal's office anymore!" But I messes up too much, and put everyone in danger. Mama says I need to learn from my mistakes. [A single tear falls down her cheek.] So, I know what I have to do now...

[Cut to the next day at the Haunted Hayride where Camila's dropping everybody off. Amity, Gus, and Hunter, true to their word, are dressed as Hecate, Captain Avery, and Chief Engineer O'Bailey while Willow's wearing the devil costume she bought. After walking forward and pocketing their palismen, Luz gets out, her Azura costume designed to be a tunic with purple pants instead of being a dress.]

Luz: Make sure to help Vee with the trick-or-treaters. You know, they can be... demanding.

Camila: Luz, are you okay? You don't look so well.

Luz: I was just so excited for this, I couldn't sleep.

Amity: All right. We'll keep the puzzle a secret 'till the time is right. And then we'll tell her about the Titan Blood!

[Belos laughing]

Hunter: Did you hear that?

[Flapjack chirps]

Hunter: Hey, it's okay. It's probably just in my head again. Nestle down, Flapjack.

[chirps]

Amity: We're gonna have the best night, and we might even have surprise for you.

Luz: Yeah, me too.

Actor 1: I hath seen the Mrs. Smith consorting with spirits unpure.

Actor 2: Is this true, Mrs. Smith?

Mrs. Smith Actor: Nay, 'tis a fool lie! Inquisitor Jones is tarring me a demon's varlet so as to take mine fields!

Actor 1: Demon lies!

Gus: Your honor, I do object! It is Inquisitor Jones who's in league with the dark forces!

Actor 1: [out of character] Kid, come on, this is my spotlight.

Gus: Behold. [uses illusion magic to turn his legs red and animal-like.]

Actor 1:[gasps, screams]

[crowd cheering]

Jacob: Why are you clapping? [gasps, grunts] These children are demon spawn. And they want your teeth! Look! Look at his ears! He's from Mars!

Gus: Hey, lay off the costume, man.

[two security guards tackle Jacob to the ground]

Jacob: [screams] Let go! [groans]

[Woman sighs]

Masha: I hope you're all prepared for a truly scary ride.

Gus and Willow: Make us cry! Make us cry!

Masha: Because there's nothing scarier than knowledge.

Gus: Boo, just lie to me!

Masha: Let me tell you the eeriest unsolved mystery of Gravesfield. The Tale of the Brothers Wittebane.

[The group becomes intrigued]

Amity: [to Luz and Hunter] Wittebane? Isn't that Belos?

Masha: The year is 1613. Two orphaned brothers arrive in Gravesfield. Their names? Philip... [flashes back to Belos] and Caleb. [flashes back to Hunter]

Hunter: Oh, no.

[As Masha narrates the story, cardboard cutouts depicting events that happened to Philip and Caleb play out in the background as the gang watches.]

Masha: Caleb did his best to take care of his younger brother. They tried to fit in with this town, and its unsavory practices. They became witch-hunters! Local lore suggests that the Brothers Wittebane met a real witch from another world! Her name was Evelyn. And the older brother was spirited away. She dazzled him with magic and visions of a strange yet beautiful place. They used a secret code to travel between worlds. Philip set off to save his brother and bring the witch to justice. But neither were ever seen again! Maybe Philip saved Caleb, and they went on to lead peaceful lives. Or maybe [turns on a flashlight and points it at their face] he's still chasing his brother, caught in a cycle of horror and strife!

[all gasp]

Masha: [turns off the flashlight] Sounds like big bro got a hot witch girlfriend and little bro got upset. But that's just me.

[The hayride ends and the gang gets out of the tractor. Nearby. Hunter hears Belos laughing, which terrifies him.]

Hunter: [gasps] Luz.

[Hunter grabs Luz and takes her behind a tractor. Luz yelps]

Luz: What's going on?

Hunter: It's him. He's here! I saw him this time. And it wasn't in my head after all. You believe me, right?

Luz: Well, how can you be sure? What would he be doing here?

Hunter: Titan Blood. I'm not supposed to tell. But the secret code that guide mentioned? It's a puzzle, a rebus we found in the shack. Amity thinks it leads to Titan Blood!

Luz: Titan Blood? Puzzles? Amity? Why didn't anyone say anything?

Hunter: You and your mom do so much for us. We wanted to do something for you, and she's gonna surprise you with it tonight.

Luz: [uncertainly] That is so sweet.

Amity: [realizes something] Hey, where's Luz and Hunter?

Luz: We need to find the Titan Blood first. Just to make sure. I don't wanna freak anyone out yet.

Hunter: You don't believe me yet, do you? Fine. I'll prove he's here. Flapjack! [Flapjack chirps] Can you get the rebus? I'll say that again. [distorted with Belos' voice] Get the rebus!

[chirping]

Luz: Hey! What the heck?

Hunter: Sorry. I don't know what came over me.

[chirping]

Hunter: Good work.

[Cut to Camila that night. She is finishing watching a movie with Vee, who has fallen asleep. She picks up Luz's laptop, trips, and barely catches herself and the laptop. This motion opens the laptop to Luz's video diary.]

Camila: [grunts, pants] Oh! [gasps, sighs]

Young Luz 1: So we moved. Mom says it's because the house isn't "pretty enough", but I think it's because there's a better hospital for dad nearby. 'Cause, let's be honest, this house ain't that much prettier.

Young Luz 2: I think this might be the worst week ever. [Camila's hand is now on the screen and slowly sliding down] But Dad left me this book. I can't wait to read it.

Young Luz 3: I loved it! I loved it so much! [giggles]

Young Luz 4: Look what I got at the convention. [laughs] I'm gonna cut my hair with it. [cuts to another recording not long after the previous one] That was a bad idea!

Young Luz 5 (Soon before the beginning of the series): Mom saw my report card. "Mija, if you just applied yourself." But I am applying myself. My baseball stitches are so small, they're practically invisible. And I can read and write Witchtongue in five different dialects. Also, I can sit so perfectly still that woodland creatures come and sit on me. [She demonstrates by sitting in a chair completely immobile: a spider soon descends on top of her head.] But I guess none of this is gonna matter on the SATs. It's been really rough for Mom since the funeral. So, I'm gonna wow my teacher's face off with this book report! Mom, you won't have to worry about me ever again.

Luz: Mama says I have to learn from my mistakes. So, I know what I have to do now. On Halloween, after the Hayride, I'm telling everyone I'm staying in the Human Realm. Permanently.

[Cut back to Luz and Hunter running through the woods]

Hunter: [Removes the bandage from his finger, noticing the green goo] What the... [Sees an image of Belos in the woods] There! [Runs off panting]

Luz: Hunter! [panting] Hunter! Think. Think. Hunter is following the rebus to the Titan's Blood. But how can I find the blood without him? Come on. You can do this. [gasps] Glyphs are powered by the magic of the isles, by the Titan itself! Closer I am to the Titan Blood, the stronger the glyphs become.

Willow: Luz? Hunter?

Amity: Did you find them?

Gus: Calm down. They probably just went to buy some more cars.

Amity: Yeah. Yeah. You're right. I just- I wanted to show Luz the rebus. Wait. Where did it go?

[all gasp]

Camila: Kids! Have you seen Luz? And has she, um, said anything weird?

Vee: Boom! Find a phone.

[beeping]

Luz: Hunter, are you okay? Did you see Belos?

Hunter: Oh, no. Just my imagination playing tricks again. Why don't you find the Titan Blood while I find my palisman? Little guy got spooked off.

Luz: Good idea. All this Belos talk has me on edge. But I hate to ruin Amity's surprise. I really appreciate that everyone wanted to do this. You guys are great friends.

Hunter: Have you found the blood yet?

Luz: I'm on it. I just have to-

[Flapjack chirping]

Luz: Flapjack? Why do you look so scared?

Belos (as Hunter): Luz. [distorted] Didn't you use an ice glyph to get here? Your magic is working.

Amity: Luz? I think she's this way.

Camila: Mija?

Willow: Hunter?

Gus: Guys, where are you?

Amity: Luz?

Belos (as Hunter): I saw you. Glyphs do work here.

Luz: You. You survived.

Belos (as Hunter): I did. Thanks again for all the help, Luz. But I don't need you anymore.

Luz: Flapjack!

Belos (as Hunter): Ah. There you are.

[The vial is knocked out of Belos' hand by an ice spike. Luz launches more glyphs at him, but all of her attacks miss]

Belos (as Hunter): You're not even trying right now. What? Afraid you'll hurt him?

Camila: Is that Hunter?

Gus: Something's wrong.

Belos (as Hunter): See, this is why you're so useful, Luz. You're so desperate to help people, you even helped me meet the Collector.

Amity: What?

Luz: I didn't mean to. I thought I was doing something good!

Belos (as Hunter): You did do something good. I thought this one was another lost cause. Because of you, we can finish our work as witch-hunters, starting with them!

[Belos starts to reach for the witches, but Amity summons her palisman to swat away his hand, following with Gus and Willow also summoning their palismen to fly and attack Belos. Belos manages to swat away one of Gus' illusions and a purple blast of magic.]

Belos (as Hunter): [laughs]

Gus: Hey, Belos. Remember me?

[Belos once again tries to grab Gus, only to grab another illusion as Willow grabs one of his stretched arms and slams it down.]

Vee: Hang tight, Hunter! [starts draining his magic with her powers]

Amity: Vee, watch out!

[Gus grunts, all scream]

Luz: [grunts] I know you can hear me, Hunter. Fight him off!

[both grunt, Luz screams]

[Flapjack starts chirping and pecking at Belos's antlers, but the latter immediately catches him.]

Belos (as Hunter): That's right. You wouldn't want me harming your precious palisman, would you? Oh, but then again, I don't care what you want. Goodbye, Evelyn.

[Cracks Flapjack and starts absorbing his essence, but lets him go as Hunter's personality starts fighting him over the control of his body. Flapjack then flies into Luz' palm while leaking palisman essence from the cracks in his body.]

[gasps, groans]

Luz: [crying] Flapjack! Flapjack, you'll be okay.

Hunter: [groaning] You know what I'd like, Belos? [groaning] I'd like to leave the Emperor's Coven and never step foot in that throne room again. I'd like to study wild magic, and learn how to carve palismen. I'd like to attend Hexside as a regular student and play flyer derby with my friends. But most of all, I'd like to make sure you never hurt anyone again! [grunts]

[Hunter throws the vial of Titan's blood into the river.]

Belos (as Hunter): No!

[Belos jumps into the water, managing to catch the vial but falls unconscious as a result.]

Luz: Oh, no! No!

Camila: Move.

[She jumps into the water to save him and manages to rescue him. The others help her hoist Hunter into the surface.]

Willow: Be careful with him!

[Belos finally leaves Hunter's body as he takes the monstrous form he previously had.]

Belos: Caleb! You would stab me in the back?!

Luz: [stares at him angrily] You did it to him first.

[Belos, outraged, smashes the vial of Titan's blood into the archway, opening a portal to the Demon Realm.]

Belos: [growls] This is for the good of your souls. You'll thank me later.

[He goes through the portal, leaving everyone speechless.]

Camila: That's the Belos you've been fighting this whole time?!

Willow: [after moving Hunter for a while] Guys, Hunter isn't moving.

Camila: Vee, call an ambulance. [Vee immediately does so]

Willow: [tearing up] Uh, do human doctors know about possession?

Luz: Or Grimwalkers?

Camila: Possession?!

Willow: Grimwalkers?!

Camila: We should still call a doctor.

Vee: I'm not getting cell reception.

Amity: What do we do?

[A weakened Flapjack flies out of Luz's pocket to Hunter, chirps sadly, then settles down, sacrificing his life by giving him his palisman essence to revive Hunter as the others sadly watch on; He dissolves into floating balls of light in the end.]

Hunter: [groans and slowly opens his eyes, which have turned brown] Hey, guys. Is everyone else okay?

Gus: Actually, Flapjack...

Hunter: Don't. Don't. [cries] I already know.

[The others, especially Luz, who turns away, start to cry as well.]

Camila: Sit up slowly, baby. Are you in pain anywhere?

Hunter: I'm okay.

Amity: Um, Luz. What did Belos mean when he said you helped him meet The Collector? I mean, that was a lie, right?

Luz: No, it was true. [walks away] If it weren't for me, the Day of Unity would have never happened. There was this time pool, and I met him. I met him when he was still just Philip, and I taught him the light spell. I introduced him to The Collector. I set everything in motion. I'm sorry, everyone.

Amity: Why did you keep all that a secret?

Luz: I was scared. I thought you'd all hate me for it. Which is why I've made a decision. I think it'd be in everyone's best interest if I-

Camila: Took your mama to the Demon Realm!

Luz: What?!

Amity: [approaches Luz and hugs her] I couldn't hate you, Luz. The fact that you still stand up for us means enough to me.

Camila: Mija, now that I've seen what you're up against, there is no way I'm letting you go back there alone. It is our duty to help your friends get back to their families.

Luz: But...

Hunter: You were tricked. That's what Belos does. He tricks people. But if it weren't you, it would have been someone else, and then there'd be no one left to fight back. So let's do that. Let's fight back. Please? For Flapjack?

Luz: ...For Flapjack.

[portal pulsing]

Vee: The portal's closing.

Luz: Then we better head in.

[Hunter heads for the portal first.]

Hunter: [groans] Time to go home, Flap. [phases through the portal]

[Gus and Willow follow him, both saying their goodbyes to the Human Realm.]

Gus: Goodbye, Human Realm. Thank you for showing me your secrets. I hope to see you again. [phases through the portal]

Willow: Thanks for the memories. We'll be back after we get some revenge. [phases through the portal]

Amity: Luz, I know things are scary, and I don't know what the future holds. But it would be so cool if you were a part of that. But no more hiding, okay?

Luz: I understand. See you on the other side. Promise.

[Luz and Amity hold hands as the latter gives Luz a kiss on the cheek. They let go of each other's hands as Luz watches Amity walk through the portal with her staff.]

Vee: [hands Camila the baseball bat] Here, you'll probably need this.

Camila: A-are you coming, Vee?

Vee: I don't think I'm ready. Besides, [morphs into Camila] someone has to keep up appearances.

Camila: Tell the staff I've gone home to see my abuela, okay? Carmen's in charge, Dianne has my schedule. And, [hugs Vee] thank you, Vee. [to Luz] are you ready?

Luz: Are you? I'm not sure what we'll see on the other side.

Camila: Then we don't wanna leave unprepared. [points towards her costume hat] A good witch always has to have her hat.

[Luz and Camila hold hands as the two step inside the portal, prepared. Afterwards, the portal closes. Vee starts to walk away when she realizes something.]

Vee: Shoot, Camila still has the car keys!

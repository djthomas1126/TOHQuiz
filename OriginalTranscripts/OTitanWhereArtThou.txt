King: Eh?

[King hears a laugh. It seems to be coming from the Collector.]

The Collector: [Giddily.] Almost free, almost free!

King: Luz? Hooty? Woah, woah! [Starts floating.] Is someone there?

The Collector: I won't be alone, I won't be alone anymore! [Cackles.]

King: Hello, hello?

The Collector: Who said that? Who's there?

King: What...?

The Collector: Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Don't leave! Come back!--

[King wakes up back on the boat, confused, gasping and breathing heavily. Luz has just awaken him from his dream.]

Luz: Hey, sleepyhead. We're back in Bonesborough.

[King looks out from the edge of the ship and looks at the bones of the Titan, coming to terms again that he's one of them.]

[Luz waves and exits the boat and pulls out her little device. She's received a lot of texts from Amity. Hooty, still in his portable state, looms over her shoulder.]

Luz: Hmmm. "Mom took Pensta, but we're safe. We'll contact." Aww, she sent so many hearts! Hope she's doing okay.

King: Is that Amity? It's okay if you wanna check on her. I can get to the Owl House on my own.

[Luz has a flashback to the events from the previous episode.]

King (flashback): I think they might be my family! Maybe they're an answer to all our problems!

Bill (flashback): If you think Belos is evil, you've never seen a live Titan.

Luz (flashback): King, you're not one of them.

King (flashback): Then what am I?!

Luz (flashback): You're a Titan, King. You're the son of the Boiling Isles. [This greatly shocks King.]

[Back to the present time.]

Hooty: Hey, look! Everyone missed us so much they put up pretty signs!

[Four wanted posted are displayed on the screen. One featuring a demonically drawn Hooty, another of Harpy Eda, then one with Luz casting a glyph spell with King next to her, and the last one featuring Lilith holding fire in her hand. Two witches growl at what seems to be Hooty.]

Luz: [Pulls her hood up.] Let's take the long way home.

[King, Luz, and Hooty retreat back to the Owl House. Upon sensing someone coming, Luz quickly activates an invisibility glyph as she, King and Hooty hide from two Coven Scouts.]

Coven Scout #1: Without that bird-tube, this place was wide open! [drinks from a giant jug of Apple Blood]

Coven Scout #2: I still haven't recovered from that tea party. [Shudders at the memory.]

[Luz exhales once they're gone and the three walk into the Owl House. The place is deserted, ransacked, everything inside is confiscated and Eda and Lilith are nowhere to be seen.]

King: Do you think they were arrested?

[Luz finds a piece of paper on the ground that provides instructions on where they are. She activates a light glyph so she can seen the writing better.]

Luz: No, they're hiding out on the Knee!

[Transition over to the Knee of the Titan.]

Lilith: Using my old keys, we'll travel through the service tunnels. From there, we initiate the security system and everyone including Belos will be trapped inside the castle. Boom! Day of Unity stopped!

Eda: You don't think they changed the locks after you got booted from the Coven?

Lilith: Well, at least I'm coming up with ideas.

Eda: Hey! I come up with some great ideas! [Puts a bag of Hex Mix over her head.]

Lilith: Putting snorse glue in the Emperor's shampoo bottle isn't going to save anyone's life!

[Lilith kicks a bag of Hex Mix on the ground.]

Lilith: This is just like you. You never take things seriously! At least Luz and King are far away from here.

Eda: Someone's tripped the booby trap.

[Lilith and Eda head over to the location of the trap and find their palismen looking at Luz (now wearing her fur hat, her fingerless gloves and a pair of white boots), King, and Hooty trapped inside it.]

Hooty: Hey, Lulu!

Luz: Hiiiiii.

[Later on, everyone is gathered around a Fire Bee pit while Luz explains what happened.]

Luz: It took awhile to figure out which town you're in from your map. I had to keep off the streets with all those wanted posters, but that's when we saw your Hex Mix trail and well, you know the rest!

Eda: What map are you talking about?

Luz: The one you left us, obviously.

Eda: Oh! [Stares directly at Lilith.] The one we left them!

Lilith: Well, someone had to bury our bones!

Hooty: Lulu! I got you a shirt!

[He throws up an orange t-shirt on her lap (to her disgust) that says "I was Sacrificed to the Grand Huntsman!", much to her and Eda's surprise.]

Lilith: [Reading the text on the shirt.] I was sacrificed to the Grand Huntsman?

Eda: What the-?

Luz: So... turns out King's letter was sent by a bunch of Titan Trappers. And they may have tried to sacrifice King to the Collector, who they worship.

Eda: Oh, so you found of a commune of [Glares at Lilith.] bloodthirsty fanatics in a place that was supposed to be empty!

Lilith: Well, they couldn't have been that scary without any Titans to trap!

Luz: Actually... [Looks down at King.]

King: Mhm..

Luz: King... is a Titan.

King: Looks like I'm... due for a growth spurt soon... heh, heh.

[Lilith and Eda's eyes widen and they gasp in shock.]

[Scene transitions over to where King wraps a scarf around a snow bunny resembling Francois. Afterwards, King looks towards the scenery sadly. Seeing this, Hooty wraps himself around him to hug him.]

Eda: I can't believe that little guy is gonna turn into that big guy.

Luz: Certainly explains his strange new powers. He's just dealing with so much. I wish there was a way we could give him some comfort.

Lilith: I can't believe this! All this time you've had a Titan under your roof! [Gasps.] I've eaten ice cream with a god!

Luz: Just because he has tall genes doesn't mean he's a god.

Eda: And he falls into the toilet like once a day.

Lilith: Perhaps he's still too young. His powers haven't... awakened yet. But who knows how he can help us against Belos!

Eda: Don't worry Luz, we're not putting him in danger. [Scowling.] He's a Clawthorne and technically your nephew, remember, dear sister?

Lilith: Right, of course. [Runs off.] I'm a god's aunt! But is he a gentle god or an angry god?

Luz: So? Fill me in! How are we gonna defeat Belos and his draining spell?

Eda: Uh, right. Well... it's a secret!

[Luz pouts.]

Eda: Just for now. I'll fill you in closer to go time!

Luz: Ah, so if I'm captured I can't give anything away! Smart thinkin', Owl Lady!

King: [Finishes building a snow bunny.] There! All done! Nice to meet you Fran-snow...ois. [Arm of the snow bunny slips off and he becomes dejected.]

Luz: Aw, King, let me help with that.

[Luz walks off and Lilith enters the area.]

Lilith: What are you doing?! Tell her!

Eda: Tell her what? That we have no plan? That Belos is gonna win? That the Boiling Isles are doomed? [Sighs.] The kids deserve one nice day before they realize how dire things are.

[Luz makes an ice arm using an ice glyph.]

Lilith: [Shouts.] And King deserves our praise! [Eda glares at her.]

Eda: Alright, kids! The uh... plan isn't gonna be ready till tomorrow, but if you could do anything if you could do anything in the world today, what would it be?

King: Thanks, Eda, but I just want things to be normal right now.

Luz: Well, I wanna go on a heist!

Eda: Of course you do.

[There's a transition of scenes and now Lilith is walking over to King with a cup of tea.]

Lilith: King of... um, Titans, would you... like some tea?

King: Uh, no thanks. I'm... I'm good.

Lilith: Of course! Titans don't care for such lowly pleasures. [Throws the tea cup away.] Perhaps I could offer you dark [Pulls out a sword.] deeds carried out in your name.

King: [Slightly horrified.] Uh, no. Listen, it's okay. I just uh need some alone time. Your Titan... commands it?

[Lilith bows, her hair covering her entire face. She used her foot to hint for Hooty to bow as well, then grabs him and walks away, her hair still covering her face. King walks off.]

[Scene transition to Eda and Luz riding on the former's staff.]

Luz: I saw scouts taking boxes from the house. They're probably holding everything at the Bonesborough Precinct, Francois included.

Eda: Are you sure you wanna do this for a stuffed toy? Wouldn't you rather, oh I don't know, have a beach day?

Luz: Maybe if we had time for 20 more adventures, but we don't. Besides, this is for King! He needs his buddy.

[Luz and Eda land in between two buildings and watch mysterious cloaked people walk while holding candles.]

Coven Scout #1: Ugh, I hate double-shifts. Can't wait for the day after the Day of Unity. Know what I mean?

Coven Scout #2: Sure, but, I'm racking up OT like crazy!

Luz: [Gasps.] There, look! [She points at a box holding Francois.] Francois! Let's pounce!

Eda: Hold up! If we're gonna do this we gotta do it right. Belos isn't taking any more chances with us after your little trip into his mind. If we wanna stay alive we have to be inconspicuous.

[Eda and Luz suddenly burst inside the building, disguised as Coven Scouts.]

Eda (disguised): [In a fake voice.] Take me to my... I mean the Owl Lady's confiscated junk!

Luz (disguised): Nice save.

[Scene changes to King sadly walking around Bonesborough.]

Steve: Lose your way, little guy?

[King finds Steve sitting on an unknown motorcycle.]

King: Actually I got where I was going but now I, uh... eh? [Realizes something.] Hey, I know you! You're Steve from Lilith's party! Shouldn't you be like kissing the Emperor's butt right now?

Steve: Probably. Heck, growing up, all I wanted was to be an Emperor's Coven Scout, to be considered one of the best. I got what I wanted, but it's not what I thought it was.

King: I hear that.

Steve: Belos is supposed to know everything, but why should he know what the Titan wants? Maybe the Titan doesn't even know what he wants? Maybe he's just some normal guy, you know? [Sighs.] Anyway, you going somewhere, cause I've got a sidecar and nothing but time!

[King hops into the sidecar and Steve puts a helmet over his head.]

King: I point, you drive.

[The sidecar heads off.]

[Back in the Knee, Hooty eats a bunch of fire bees with his giant mouth.]

Lilith: Did I insult him by groveling too much? Did I not grovel enough?

Hooty: Maybe he wants to be treated like, I don't know, normal?

Lilith: Nonsense! He's a Titan, for Titan's sake! [Gasps.] Oh, Titan, I just took his name in vain. Ah! I did it again!

Hooty: Uh, Lulu, I think we have a bigger problem.

[They notice King has gone missing.]

[Scene changes back to the storage area. None of the Coven Scouts notice a still-disguised Eda and Luz.]

Luz (disguised): I would have appreciated some kind of reaction. These were hard to get.

Eda (disguised): Hey you, fellow guard! We just found a lot of illegal Hexes Hold'em cards. Can we get the key to the warehouse?

[The Coven Scout gives them the key. Luz and Eda enter an elevator by using the key.]

Eda (disguised): Why's everything going our way now?

Luz (disguised): Maybe our luck's finally turning!

[They enter the warehouse and start to look around.]

Eda: Woo, boy, we're gonna need to split up if we want to find Francois.

[The two take off their disguise helmets. Eda gives Luz her staff.]

Eda: If things get hairy, you fly out of here as fast as you can. [Luz gives her a very pouty face] Hey! Don't give me that face, just say okay, okay?

Luz: Okay.

Eda: Oh, and if you find a box labelled, "Eda's Longest Toenails", grab that, too.

Luz: [Chuckles.] Ew.

[The two walk off in separate directions. Eda suddenly hears a Guard Captain conversing with someone through a crystal ball.]

Guard Captain: We secured the Owl Lady's house that's correct, Head Witch. [Pauses.] No, there was no sign of her.

Raine: Just keep looking until you find her and only come to me when you do.

Eda: [Shocked.] Raine.

[Scene switches back over to Steve and King. King and Steve travel all throughout the Boiling Isles, King coming to terms with who he is. The scene begins with Steve reading a book and King viewing what looks like to be a tooth of the Titan. While this is happening, Hooty and Lilith are right on their tails, trying to find King but always being one step behind.]

[Scene switches back to the warehouse.]

Guard Captain: Head Witch, I'll do all I can to find the Owl Lady. You have my word.

Raine: Your word doesn't count much without results. Just go.

[The call ends and the Guard Captain leaves. After she does, Eda then emerges from an invisibility glyph inside the room. She reactivates the call with Raine.]

Raine: [Rubbing their eyes.] Captain, I thought I told you to-- [Gasps.] Eda?

Eda: Please, just give me a minute. I'm not trying to stir trouble.

Raine: [Scowling at Eda.] You're wearing a stolen uniform.

Eda: And I am [Flings her hair.] working it! Listen, I don't know what you're hiding, but I do know that somewhere deep inside you still care about me, otherwise you wouldn't let me walk free at the Coven Parade. [Stops, then continues.] Raine, I know about the Day of Unity and the Draining Spell.

[Raine's emotion shifts and they look away, but not before Eda spots it.]

Eda: Nope, I-I saw that expression! It is that bad, isn't it? That's why I... [Sighs.] I need your help.

Raine: There's no time for your schemes, Eda. [Is about to end the call when Eda stops them.]

Eda: Wait! This is for my kids. They can't be around during the Day of Unity. Put them in a castle, bunker, get them on an airship, I don't care, just, just, keep them safe! If you do, I'll give myself up right now.

Raine: I- [Their sentence is interrupted by Terra when she enters the room.]

Terra: Come along, sprout. Places to be, hedges to trim!

Eda (disguised): [Salutes.] Awaiting further instructions, Head Witch.

Raine: Stay put. I'll send someone to receive the package.

Terra: Your uniform looks outdated, captain. Looking like a pile of compost.

[The call ends. Eda removes her mask and sighs in relief. However, much to her surprise, Luz speaks up from behind her.]

Luz: Eda? Are you sending me away?

[Eda is silent, not knowing what to say.]

Luz: You're... you're sending me away? But I can help! Why don't you get that yet?!

[A Coven Scout overhears Luz shouting at Eda and stops to listen.]

Luz: CALL RAINE BACK! TELL THEM THERE'S NO PACKAGE TO RECEIVE! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL BELOS IS DEFEATED!

[The Coven Scout runs off.]

Eda: No.

Luz: After everything we've been through, I can't believe you're still underestimating me. Fine. Let's just get back to King.

[Eda turns into Harpy Eda and blocks Luz while walking down the stairs.]

Harpy Eda: You're going with Raine. They'll keep you safe!

Luz: You can't make me. [Holds up an ice glyph.]

Harpy Eda: Yes, I can.

[Luz places the glyph on the ground and activates it, triggering a bulk of ice that almost hits Eda in the eye. Luz flies over some boxes with Owlbert to escape Eda.]

Harpy Eda: Owlbert! [Owlbert leaves his staff form, leading to Luz falling.]

[Eda almost has Luz until she grabs a light glyph and shines it in Eda's face, stopping her in her tracks. Luz gets away for a short amount of time with an invisibility glyph, but Eda spots her again and stops her.]

Harpy Eda: Luz, please!

[Luz refuses to listen and places down another ice glyph, using it to make a sheet of ice where she slides directly under Eda. However, she smashes the ice, leading to Luz falling again.]

Harpy Eda: Raine will be here soon. I'll have King join you afterwards.

Luz: But I can help with your plan!

Harpy Eda: It's time to go.

[Eda suddenly gets struck with a magic beam.]

Guard Captain: Hands up, Owl Lady!

[Eda rushes towards the scouts and attacks them. Luz attempts to join but gets trapped in a net.]

Luz: Eda! [A scout traps her in a magic net.]

[Eda tries to fight the Abomatons, but she also ends up getting trapped in a net.]

Guard Captain: Lock 'em up, and use the heavy-duty stuff this time. [The Abomatons begin to drag a trapped Eda and Luz away.]

[Scene transition back to Steve and King.]

Steve: Hey, uh, your drink's gettin' warm.

King: You know, Steve, I always wanted to have power and command respect and fear! So, now that I kinda have all that, why does my stomach feel all... ugh?

Steve: Wants can change, so can people.

King: I don't want people to see me as a big scary monster anymore.

[Steve tasks off his mask and lets King put a worm he spotted in it.]

Steve: Me neither.

Lilith: Unhand him, you coven shill!

[Lilith and Hooty find the two and are ready to attack, but Lilith recognizes Steve.]

Lilith: Wait, Steve?

King: It's okay, it's okay! He's not a scout anymore! Did I read that right?

Steve: Mhm.

Lilith: Nevertheless. Let me shield you with my pitiful life, oh powerful-

King: Stop! I'm still King, King! Isn't this how you acted with the Emperor? I'm sensing a little bit of a pattern with you.

Steve: Hey, girl, I've been there! I can recommend a good therapist!

Hooty: HE'S TRICKING YOU! ATTACK PLAN ACTIVATED!

[Hooty slams directly into Steve and he screams.]

[Scene changes back inside the building. Eda and Luz get thrown inside behind bars.]

Guard Captain: [While reading a clipboard.] An envoy from the castle is coming to collect the human. The Owl Lady is to be taken to the Conformatorium for petrification. A real one this time.

Eda: Why don't you just save yourself the trouble and put me down now.

Luz: You happy now? This way, neither of us can stop Belos.

[Eda looks away guiltily.]

Luz: Why couldn't you just let me help with your stupid plan?! Is it 'cause I'm a kid? Do you think I'm still that weak?! Well?!

Eda: [Snaps.] It's because there is no plan, okay?!

[Luz gasps in shock.]

Eda: Me and Lilith don't have magic and we don't have allies, we're useless. We have you and King. So, I was gonna do anything to make sure that you were safe. But now... [Turns away.] it's all over.

[An Abomaton enters the room, putting them into a locked carriage.]

Luz: Let go! Belos is a witch hunter! You, you have to listen! Ah!

[She gets thrown inside the vehicle.]

Luz: Eda? Eda, can you hear me? I'll listen to you now, I'll do whatever you say, just fight back! [Eda gets thrown into a different carriage.] Please! Eda! [The window on her vehicle closes.]

[Later on, a vengeful Luz is seen on the carriage. Once the ride stops, she growls furiously and bursts out of the carriage. Abomination goo then grabs her.]

Luz: [Shouts.] Where is she? Take me to Eda! [She is now hanging upside down.] If you touch a single feather on her head, I'll... I'll...

Eda: Luz, [Laughing.] Luz! It's okay.

[Luz opens her eyes to find Eda, Lilith, Hooty, King, Raine, the BATS and Steve in front of her. Darius is revealed to be on top of her carriage, with Eberwolf accompanying him.]

Darius: I'm going to set you down, please try not to bite anyone. [Slowly lets her down.]

Luz: What's going on? [The BATS and Steve wave at her.] Who are these people?

[Eberwolf uses his teeth to bite apart Luz's handcuffs.]

King: Luz! [Hugs her.]

Luz: King! [Hugs him back as Raine walks towards them.]

Raine: So, you must be the famous human witch. Eda's been bragging about you for hours. I'm Raine.

Luz: Oh my gosh, [Squirms happily.] I can't believe I'm actually meeting you in person! I heard all about you adventures with Eda, and how you became Head Witch of Bard Coven, where you're secretly a spy! A-And then you and Eda played that duet and, [Gasps.] and then you got captured.

King: And your memories got all scram-jambled.

Raine: Actually, when Darius captured me, he was really protecting me.

Darius: I thought I was the only one who found this Day of Unity junk suspicious. [Hops off the carriage and walks towards Raine.] When I heard Raine was causing trouble, I had a feeling they'd know more. You would've been locked away if it weren't for me.

Raine: And a little less bruised! You could've let me in on things before attacking me!

Darius: You're a horrible actor! I had to make it look real!

Raine: Ugh, this is just like Hexside.

Steve: [To Lilith.] Did you know of any of this stuff when you were in charge?

Lilith: I'm... starting to think I wasn't very good at my job.

Eda: [Walking towards Raine.] Raine, why didn't you tell me anything? I could've helped.

Raine: Is it so unbelievable that I wanted to keep you safe? But, in typical Eda fashion, [Eda looks towards Luz and King, who are hugging.] you're not gonna stop until you make things right.

Eda: [Smiles.] I guess not.

Lilith: Things aren't hopeless! They have a plan to stop Belos and the Draining Spell!

Luz: [Gasps.] Really? Wait, wait, before you get into that, please tell me you have a cool rebel name!

Raine: Actually, we do. Allow me to introduce... [Begins walking around the group.]

Darius: Wait, hold on.

Raine: The Covens Against the Throne...

Darius: We talked about this, you promised!

Raine: AKA...

Darius: [Furiously.] I DID NOT AGREE TO THIS NAME!

Raine: The CATS! [The group hisses.]

Luz: [Pulls on her hoodie.] Everything's come full circle, baby!

[Scene switches to the secret base of the CATS. The group is gathered on the table. Hooty and Lilith have fallen asleep beside it. Luz, Eda and King are sitting on the bunk bed. Eda opens her bag and brings out Francois.]

King: [Squeaking happily.] Francois! [Hugs him.]

Eda: [Brings out a cardboard box.] Look what else is in here.

[The box is labeled, "EDA'S LONGEST TOENAILS (DON'T OPEN!)" Luz gags in disgust and opens it hesitantly, but gasps in surprise to find the palistrom wood given to her by Eda and King after her adventure with Hunter.]

Luz: It's... palistrom wood.

Eda: I thought you'd wanna carve your palisman. What do you say? [Brings out a chisel from her hair.]

Luz: I shouldn't. The Day of Unity is in two days, I have to focus o-on stopping Belos, and--- [Gets cut off by Eda hugging her.]

Eda: You goob. Hey, this isn't all on you.

King: Yeah, we have teammates now. Meow, meow!

Luz: What if the palisman doesn't like me?

King: By my count, you've befriended more enemies than I have claws on my paw.

Eda: [Releases her from the hug.] Plenty of witches would've ditched this rock already. But you keep learning and you keep fighting... what's not to like, huh?

[Luz is red on the face and looks like she's about to cry herself, touched by Eda's words.]

Luz: Thanks, Eda. [Sniffles and grabs the box.] I think I'm ready to carve. [Chuckles.] Um, you're gonna show me how to do this, right?

Eda: Oh, duh. My dad taught me the ropes. Here, let's make sure we have some space. [Takes the wood and sets it upwards.] Lay the wood here...

King: [Eagerly.] Are you gonna carve me?

Eda: [Chuckles and takes the chisel.] Calm down, King. [Luz sets the box aside.] Now, let's take it slow.

[Scene zooms out to show a view of the Titan's head.]

Eda: [Voiceover.] We've got all the time in the world.

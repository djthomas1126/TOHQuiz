"Luz": [Stretches.] Ah! Much better.

["Luz" lifts up the box, then stops to look at her reflection in the mirror. She smiles at it.]

"Luz": Hmm.

[Scene cuts to exterior of the house. Camila is seen standing beside her car and "Luz" is walking down the steps.]

Camila: [Closes car door.] What's the box for, mija? [Walks towards "Luz".]

"Luz": Just cleaning up a little. [Smiles and looks down at the box.]

Camila: Even this? [Picks up the tin foil swan.] You used to love making me tinfoil swans.

"Luz": Oh, I'm, uh, [Takes back the tin foil swan.] just looking for a fresh start.

[Camila looks at Luz walking towards the trash can with a slightly weirded out expression on her face.]

"Luz": Camp taught me a lot, you know? [Sets down box beside the trash can.]

Camila: [Looks at "Luz" strangely.] Yes, it sure did...

[The sound of a rabbit squeaking is heard. Camila gasps. Scene cuts to a rabbit being caught in a trap.]

Camila: Ah! Luz, grab the pliers.

["Luz" runs away. Camila puts on a pair of latex gloves.]

Camila: [Kneels down.] Okay, okay, little bunny, you're gonna be all right. [Cuts the string.] There we go.

[The rabbit hops away.]

"Luz": That's the fifth trap this week!

Camila: If I ever catches who's responsible and then I'll pa-pow!

["Luz" giggles.]

Camila: Let's go back inside. [Boops "Luz"'s nose.] I will make maduros.

[Scene cuts back to inside the house. "Luz" stops to talk to her reflection in the mirror.]

"Luz": [Smiles.] A new life. ["Luz" opens the cupboard to take out a shirt, then closes it. The reflection changes into the real Luz looking at "Luz" with an angry expression.]

Luz: You! [Slams her hands on the mirror.]

["Luz" screams.]

[The scene shows the exterior of the Owl House. King, Eda and Hooty is looking at Luz. Luz and King are in front of a makeshift portal door.]

Luz: So, according to Philip's instructions, the hardest part to making a portal was finding someone who knew how to build it. [Puts something on the door.] But a lot of the ingredients are pretty easy to find. [Turns to look at Eda.] Your crazy apocalypse supplies finally came in handy, Eda!

[Eda snaps her finger, points at Luz and winks.]

King: Don't forget this. [Looks at Luz with a sad expression and hands her Amity's glove stained with Titan blood.]

Luz: [Stands up.] Titan blood. I can't believe something this powerful was in the old key this whole time.

[King turns to look at Eda. The duo and Hooty all have a sad expression on their faces.]

Luz: It's okay. If Belos is still trying to get to the Human Realm, he'll have to beat me to it.

[Luz tears a piece of cloth off the glove, and then sticks it on the door. She then takes a few steps backwards. Scene cuts to Eda on her makeshift flying bathtub.]

Eda: Are you sure this isn't gonna like, blow our faces off?

Luz: Nope!

Eda: Well, here goes something.

[Eda starts pedaling. The rotors start transferring kinetic energy to the various components of the door. Luz looks at the door in amazement. The pieces of the door then merges together to form a crooked portal door. The door opens, revealing not the Human Realm but a separate, surreal dimension.]

Luz: It... worked! [Runs toward the door.]

King: Did it? That looks real different from the old door!

Luz: Yeah. [Takes over her cloak from Eda.] But this is my one chance to see my mom. [Ties a rope on her waist.] If it looks like it's closing, pull!

Eda: Luz, as impressive as this is, I don't want you getting hurt.

Luz: Once I make sure my mom is okay, I'll be right back.

Eda: Just be careful. The Human Realm's filled with some real weirdos. [Winks at Luz.]

[Luz hugs Eda, King and Hooty tightly.]

Luz: Mmm!

King: Don't forget to mention me!

Luz: Okay.

[Luz puts King down and walks toward the door, She stops in front of it, stares into the dimension, then jumps into it. The screen flashes then cuts to Luz floating up from a pool of water. Luz gasps, gets up and starts coughing. A strange cube-like object appears from the water and starts floating upwards. Luz watches this and gasps. Scene zooms out and it is shown that there are multiple similar cubes floating around above.]

Luz: Did I... do something wrong? [Shouts.] Eda? King? Hooty? [More cubes appear.] Can anyone hear me?

[A cube appears. It starts flashing and making a sound, grabbing Luz's attention. She walks over and holds it in her hands. The cube starts shining brightly and the scene turns white. When it's gone, Luz finds herself inside one of the Owl House's window as a reflection.]

Luz: Am I... back at the Owl House?

[Wind blows past, pushing open the window, scaring Luz.]

Luz: Whoa! Whoa, I think I'm... in the reflection! [Taps on the window.]

[Luz then notices Eda, King and Hooty. Camera zooms out to the trio standing in front of the makeshift portal door.]

King: Do you think she's safe?

Eda: She's made it this far. We just have to trust her.

[Scene zoom in on Luz. The window flashes, then Luz disappears. Scene cuts back to the cube Luz is holding. It starts dimming and returns back to it's galaxy like form. Luz releases the cube and gasps.]

Luz: I wonder if I can see... Amity! [Blushes.]

[A cube floats up as soon as Luz finishes speaking.]

Luz: [Realizes what she's doing.] Ah! Ugh! No, no, no! [Pushes the cube down back into the water.] Come on, Luz, you're on a mission! [Squeezes in between her nose.] Camila! Camila Noceda of the Human Realm?

[Luz looks up and notices a cube flashing.]

Luz: Got ya! Ice platform!

[Luz slaps a piece of paper with ice glyph on it but it doesn't work.]

Luz: [Angrily.] Fine then! I'll do this the hard way!

[Luz jumps onto a cube floating upwards. The dimension suddenly rotates, causing Luz to fall down. The cube she was reaching for is now right in front of her. Luz reaches for it.]

Luz: Mom!

[Scene cuts to Luz's house. Luz is a reflection inside her mom's cellphone.]

Luz: [Gasps.] It's my house!

[Camera moves to the right. Camila is seen dancing to the music while opening the fridge to take something, then closes it.]

Luz: Mom!

[Camila continues dancing while humming.]

Camila: Oh yeah.

[Camila takes a hand of bananas from the counter. A family picture is shown and we see a younger Luz, Camila and an unknown male whose face is obscured by reflection.]

Luz: [Tears rolling down cheeks.] Mo—

"Luz": Mom? Do you need any help?

[Luz gasps, shocked by what she's seeing.]

Camila: Oh, are you done cleaning your room?

"Luz": Almost! With all that old stuff gone, I feel like a whole new person.

Luz: [Shocked.] Evil doppelgänger! Mom! Mom! [Knocks on cellphone's glass.] Mom! Mom!

Camila: I can finish up here, mija.

"Luz": Thanks, Mom! [Runs off to her room.]

[The cube flashes and stop showing.]

Luz: Follow her! Luz Noceda 2.0! Doppelgänger! Why won't you work?! [Exasperated sigh.] Okay, Luz, calm down. Just breathe and count to five.

[Water sloshing sound, a cube floats up, Luz notices it. The cube's screen changes, Luz walks towards it.]

"Luz": A new life. [Closes cupboard door, notices real Luz in the reflection.]

Luz: [Angrily.] You!

[Scene cuts to Camila cooking something. She hears "Luz" screaming. Scene cuts back to Luz's room again.]

Luz: So you can hear me.

"Luz": [Scared.] You're from the Demon Realm.

Luz: Listen, I just wanna—

"Luz": [Blinks.] I'm not going back! I—I won't go back! [Picks up a red baseball bat and attempts to break the mirror.]

Camila: [Outside the door.] Luz? ¿Está todo bien?

Luz: Sí, Mama! I just saw a spoiler from Monster Slayer Academia!

Camila: [Disappointed.] I'll never understand anime.

Luz: [Looks at "Luz" and shrugs.] Hmm?

["Luz" runs and jumps out the window.]

Luz: Wait!

["Luz" lands, jumps over a fence, then runs into the house where Eda used to set as an exit for her portal to the Human Realm. The inside is littered with random stuff and old newspapers. Luz appears as a reflection in a small purse mirror.]

"Luz": So this is it. I'm gonna have to run... again. [Sad expression.] Why couldn't this just work out?!

["Luz" kicks a rock, it hits a trap mechanism and accidentally triggers it. A rope tightens around her foot and drags her backwards. "Luz" becomes scared and reveals her true form, a basilisk. She groans.]

Luz: Stop moving! You'll make it tighter!

Basilisk: Huh?

Luz: I didn't mean to freak you out. I just want to figure out what's going on, okay? You're a demon from the Boiling Isles, aren't you?

Basilisk: Mm-hmm. [Reverses back to half-human form.]

Luz: [Smiles.] What's your name?

Basilisk: I'm Number F—I mean, I'm Vee.

Luz: Okay Vee, I'm gonna help free you. You're gonna be alright. Now, back up a bit, give the wire some slack. Now, look for a little metal thingamabobber. [Apologetically.] Sorry, I don't know what it's called.

[Vee finds the metal object, then pulls the rope loose.]

Luz: There you go, nice and easy.

Vee: Ah! [Pants.] Thank you. [Sobs.] You must be Camila's real daughter.

Luz: I am. But right now, I'm trapped in the Boiling Isles. Who are you, why are you pretending to be me?

Vee: I am... just looking for a place to belong.

[Luz stares at Vee with a weird expression.]

Vee: You're missing and mom... I mean, Camila seemed so kind, so I stayed with her but uh, I'll go if you—

Luz: Wait, wait, wait! Maybe we can help each other! Today I was gonna tell my mom where I've been, but because of you, she hasn't realized that I've been missing! So, keep living in my place! For now. When I get back, I can introduce her to the Demon Realm and help you find a place to live.

Vee: There's one problem. I need magic to transform and I, uh... just used the rest of it.

Luz: Hmm... [Thinks while looks to Vee's left.] Oh! [Points.] That's where we can get some magic!

[Vee picks up an old newspaper. The title reads "SECRETS OF GRAVESFIELD" and at the bottom, "BY JACOB HOPKINS".]

Vee: Secrets of Gravesfield?

Luz: No, no, that's junk. Turn it over.

[Vee turns over the paper. The title reads "STRANGE WOMAN BANNED IMMEDIATELY FROM CAFE FOR CREATING LIVING BOOKS".]

Vee: Strange woman banned from café.

Luz: That's Eda the Owl Lady. She's been coming here for years. She might have left some magic stuff behind!

Vee: Okay! [Picks up the mirror.] We can try.

[Vee walks out the door. Camera pulls slightly up, and we see a functioning CCTV installed at one of the house corners recording the room. Scene changes, showing a town sign which says "Welcome to GRAVESFIELD", "FOUNDED IN 1635". A crow is pecking on it. Vee walks by, and the crow flies away. Vee puts on a pair of tinted glasses. Scene changes again, showing statues of two people wearing clothing from the 1600s. Two crows fly by, crowing. Camera pans to the right, showing the exterior of a café called "ROBIN'S ROAST CAFE". There are people walking outside it.]

Vee: Is this it? Huh, I—I just go in and ask about that witch from the paper?

Luz: Yes. [Turns to look at the café.] Maybe they still have one of her enchanted pastries! [Turns back.] Huh? [Points at her ears.] Ears! Ears!

[Vee's ears accidentally comes out. She whimpers and quickly covers it with her animal hat. A kid notices that and points at it, but her mother drags her away. Vee pushes open the glass door. A door bell chimes. Vee starts sniffing at something.]

Shopkeeper: Hello!

[Vee yelps and quickly covers her mouth. The shopkeeper hands over a drink to a customer and turns to Vee.]

Shopkeeper: What can I get ya?

Vee: [Walks towards counter.] Uh, have any, um, magical old ladies left enchanted items here?

Shopkeeper: Ugh, you're not friends with that witch-obsessed guy, right? I told him to stop leaving pamphlets here!

Vee: [Frightened expression, looks up and points.] Actually, I'm asking about her.

Shopkeeper: Oh, Marylin?

[Camera pans up, showing a sign which says "BANNED FOR LIFE" with pictures of some people on it, one of them is Eda holding a raccoon.]

Shopkeeper: Yeah, she tried to pay for a latte with a live raccoon a couple of months ago. But when I called the cops, she did something weird to the croissants. [Picks up a croissant with a pair of tongs.] We threw 'em in the trash but... Well, [Sighs.] now we have a whole new problem.

[Vee pushes open the back door of the café, which leads to an alley, and starts sniffing around.]

Vee: I don't... smell any magic. [Hears hissing sound.] Huh?

[Two talking rats with glowing red eyes emerge from behind two boxes.]

Rats: Bread of wisdom grants us speech. We desire more!

Luz: Cool! Talking rats! Maybe they know something.

[One of the rat hisses and pounces at Vee. Vee screams and runs away. She runs to a park and stops behind a statue, panting, then turns to look at the rats. They hiss then turn back into the alley.]

Luz: Vee? Is everything alright?

Vee: Oh, [Laughs.] yeah, I—I just don't like confrontation. [Chuckles nervously.]

Luz: Oh! Well, that's okay. I'm sure there's someone else who's seen Eda. [Gasps.] There!

[Vee turns around and sees three high schoolers hanging out together under a tree, laughing. Camera zooms in Masha's hands and they're holding a deck of Hexes Hold'em card.]

Luz: Hexes Hold'em cards! Eda got rid of all her decks. I was wondering where they went...

Vee: [Sniffing.] Well, they must've run out of magic, I don't... smell anything.

Luz: But maybe they know where to get more! Okay, we gotta be careful approaching high schoolers. Mark all your exit routes—

Vee: [Laughs.] Actually, these guys are cool. [Starts walking towards the high schoolers.]

Luz: Ah! Wait, hey!

[Scene cuts back to the three high schoolers.]

Masha: A past connection that left its mark on your soul has shown up again, and it's asking you to shed your old ways and enter a metamorphosis! Becoming a spiritual leader, you're meant to be.

Boy: Yeah, that sounds about right. [Scratches himself.]

[Masha puts the card on the grass. Vee stops in front of them and kneels down.]

Vee: Hello!

[Scene cuts to Luz in the In Between Realm.]

Luz: [Panics.] Oh, she's gonna embarrass herself! [Covers her face.] I can't watch...

Masha: [Sounds from cube.] Oh, hey, Luz! Good to see you outside of prison.

Vee: [Laughs.] Come on! Camp wasn't that bad.

Luz: Camp?

[Scene cuts back to Vee and the high schoolers.]

Vee: We did have the best cabin!

Vee and High Schoolers: Cabin 7! Hoo-ha-ha! [Laughing.]

Vee: Cool cards! Where'd you get 'em?

Masha: Uh-uh. Let me give you a reading first. I wanna practice.

[Masha lays down three cards on the ground. The first shows a crescent moon as the whitespace of an abstract sideways face. The second shows a skeleton with a golden chalice, and the third shows a fish with two Y-shaped arrows behind it. Scene cuts again to Luz in the In Between Realm looking through the cube. She grabs and presses her nose up to it, perhaps intrigued.]

High Schoolers (excluding Masha): Woah.

[Cut back to Vee and the high schoolers. Ominous music starts playing.]

Masha: You're running from your past. From a previous life that was not kind to you. However, the guilt and fear you carry will eventually catch you in a self-fulfilling prophecy that you won't be able to escape from.

[Vee makes a nervous noise.]

Masha: You're gonna need some bath bombs, girl.

[Ominous music stops. They pick up the cards.]

Masha: Anyway, I got the cards over at the Gravesfield Historical Society.

Vee: [Dejectedly.] Thanks. I'll see you around.

[Vee starts to walk over to the nearby Gravesfield Historical Society.]

Masha: Did you see the look in her eyes? I gotta find out where she got those contacts.

[Vee enters the Gravesfield Historical Society building. Cut to inside the reception desk. Vee sniffs, then quietly sneezes.]

Jacob: Is it that dusty in here? Welcome to the Gravesfield Historical Society. Lemme guess, you're here to buy those weird cards, right?

Vee: How did you know?

Jacob: Well, they've been really popular with high schoolers. Yeah, saw an old lady try to dump 'em in a river a while back, but I bought them off her instead. Was really odd though, she kept asking for snails.

[Scene cuts again to Luz in the In Between Realm.]

Luz: This is it!

[Cut back to the Historical Society.]

Jacob: You want a set?

Vee: Yes, please!

Jacob: Well, I'll be just a minute, so feel free to look around.

[Jacob enters a door labelled STAFF. Vee chooses to walk into the Historical Society's museum and stand opposite a framed painting of a flag. Luz appears in the framed reflection.]

Luz: Are you okay? Hey, forget what that girl said! I know what it's like to run away from home. I did the same thing.

Vee: You and I are not the same. You had a mom who loved you, a home, a life, you had it good! And you still wanted to run away, I... I didn't have a choice. My real name is... Number Five. I'm a basilisk, and technically, I... I shouldn't exist.

[Cut to a flashback with Vee in her true form behind cell bars. Each shot in this flashback is one frame per shot.]

Vee: [Narrating.] My kind went extinct a long time ago, but we were brought back.

[Shot of Vee sucking out magic, perhaps the soul, of a small rat. Warden Wrath stands behind Vee, writing down something on a clipboard. Two Coven Scouts stand behind him.]

Vee: They wanted to know how we drained magic.

[Shot of many other basilisks trapped in these cells.]

Luz: I met a basilisk once. She hurt a lot of people.

Vee: For many of us, all we knew how to do was feed.

[Shot of Vee and a few other basilisks at a mountainside, Emperor Belos and a group of Coven Guards are looking over a cliff.]

Vee: Some of us escaped, but I knew it was only a matter of time before he caught us again.

[Shot of Vee at the back of episode 1's "human collectibles" scene. Vee sneaks behind the tent and it is implied she goes through the door to the Human Realm.]

Vee: That's when I saw you, and... and realized there might be a way out of this!

[The flashback is now fully animated. A flash of yellow light emits from the abandoned house. Vee emerges from the abandoned house where the portal was set up. Camila walks in view of the house.]

Camila: Luz? Where are you?

Vee: Eeh! [Transforms into a replica of Luz.]

Camila: Luz? There you are.

Vee (as Luz): [Nervously.] Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!

Camila: Very funny. But, I was thinking, instead of taking the bus to camp, why don't we drive? I got the day off from work, and you'll have full control of the playlist.

Vee: [Narrating.] I didn't mean to keep playing this role, but... Camila was nice to me.

[Flashback exits, return to museum. Vee is visibly upset.]

Vee: I resent you for running away. But I'm also thankful that you did. I dunno. It's... confusing.

[Vee sniffs something odd and stops the conversation.]

Luz: Do you smell something?

[Vee walks towards the room labelled STAFF. Luz disappears from the framed flag. The room is strangely pitch black.]

Vee: Where's the light?

[Vee locates a light switch and flicks it on. She gasps. Scene cuts to multiple weapons on display such as a sword, drill and an axe. Scene cuts again and shows an old picture with the words "THE HUNTING OF A DANGEROUS WITCH" underneath it. Scene cuts again and shows a flashing toy witch on a guillotine with the words "YE OLDE WITCH". A few books can be seen beside the toy. Vee walks further into the room looking around. Scene changes again, showing a deck of glowing Hexes Hold'em cards. Camera pans up and shows a bulletin board with multiple pictures of Eda. The pictures are connected to each other using red strings.]

Vee: What is all this?

[Vee bumps into a computer, turning the desktop on and revealing several tabs of video footage of Vee and the abandoned house. She screams, and runs to exit the door, but steps on a laser grid and is caged, her front mirror breaks too, rendering Luz unable to see the scene. Cut to a distressed Luz in the In Between Realm.]

Luz: [Increasingly panicked.] Vee? Vee? Vee?

[Scene cuts to exterior shot of Gravesfield Historical Society. Dark clouds start rolling in and rumble of thunder can be heard. Luz reappears in a reflection in a framed painting in the room.]

Luz (in reflection): Vee!

Vee: [Stressed, revealing true form.] Let me out!

[Jacob enters the room apprehensively, holding a stick.]

Jacob: Woah, it worked?

[Luz hides, crouching further down the framed painting.]

Jacob: I—I can't believe it, are you real? [Vee slaps stick out of Jacob's hand.] After all that time, after setting up all those traps, I... I finally caught a living, breathing demon! Oh, don't be surprised. A few years back I had a chance encounter with another one of your kind. [Holds a photograph taken of Eda's Owl Beast form.]

Jacob: Yeah, at first I couldn't believe what I saw, but after watching a few MewTube videos I learned the truth. Witches and demons are real...

[Luz gasps through the reflection.]

Jacob: ... and they're all sent from Mars to harvest human teeth to power their time machine!

[Luz strikes a cynical expression because she finds that idea very silly.]

Vee: You... don't actually know anything about us, do you?

Jacob: Oh, I know enough. I'll expose your vile plans on MewTube and finally... get my account verified. Get comfortable, demon. Cause you'll be in cages for the rest of your life. [Exits room.]

Luz: Don't worry, Vee, we can get out of this...

Vee: Go back to the Demon Realm, Luz.

Luz: Huh?

Vee: Even if I get out, he knows what my disguise looks like. He'd out me to Camila and it'd would cause her more trouble than if you just disappeared.

Luz: Vee! You're giving up too quick!

Vee: I'm being realistic. It's okay, I'm used to living like this. Goodbye, Luz.

Luz: No!

[Vee destroys the framed picture Luz is in with her tail. Back at the In Between Realm, the cube Luz was using breaks.]

Luz: Vee! Five! Number Five! Agh! [Punches black water.]

Luz: [Pauses, now more confident.] Camila Noceda.

[A cube emerges from the water. She accesses it and is transported to the reflection of Camila's phone. Camila can be seen with a box of various items from Vee's earlier packings. Camila is playing around with a tinfoil swan.]

Camila: [To tinfoil swan.] Boop.

Luz: Mom, are you there?

Camila: Huh? Luz? I didn't even hear you call!

Luz: Mom. It's so great to hear your voice.

Camila: Oh. It's great to hear you too? What's wrong?

Luz: I found out who's setting up those traps, and he's... hurting a friend of mine. But first... I have to tell you the truth. About the last few months. Let me tell you about a place called Boiling Isles.

[Camila sits down to listen to Luz's story. Fade to Camila's car arriving at the Gravesfield Historical Society building. It is shown to be dark outside.]

Camila: You know, if you wanted me to pick you and your friend up, you didn't have to make up this elaborate story about the "Demon Realm".

Luz: I'm not making it up, Mom.

Camila: [Giggles.] Don't worry, I'll play along. [Enters building.] I know this stuff made school difficult, but I'm glad you're still being creative.

[A flying pickaxe flies toward and hits a statue labelled "A WITCH" in the back. Pan right to reveal Jacob handling some boxes.]

Camila: Are you the curator here?

Jacob: Who's askin'?

Camila: A little birdie told me you caught a demon! I would love to see it!

Jacob: Wait, how did you know? Do you work for the government?

Camila: Oh. I'm a veterinarian, actually.

Jacob: So, the President sent a vet to study the demon's anatomy, huh? Sure. But first, [Picks up a voice recorder.] I'll need verbal confirmation that I get to publish my findings first. [Voice recorder beeps.]

Camila: Uh... 'kay.

Jacob: Good. [Voice recorder beeps again.] Now you're bound by law. Follow me.

Camila: [To Luz.] You even made me a part of your game! Ooh, This is so fun.

[Camila and Jacob both enter the STAFF room. Vee's cage is covered up with a rug.]

Camila: Ooh! Is this one of those escape rooms? Or, um, what do you call them, a LARP? Oh, sorry, don't want to break the illusion.

Jacob: Let me start by telling you the secret history of Gravesfield.

[Jacob walks over to wall covered with notes held together conspiracy-theorist-style. He places his hand on Camila's shoulder, though Camila brushes it away. He opens up a book and flips to an old drawing of a burning building, possibly the building the Gravesfield Historical Society was built on.]

Jacob: In the 1600s, this was a peaceful colony. Until, tragedy struck.

[Jacob flips the book to the next page to reveal a drawing of two Victorian-era dressed men, one of them shaking hands with a witch. All of their faces are somewhat rubbed out.]

Jacob: Two brothers were lured into a realm of evil by a real witch, never to be seen again. [Closes book, turns to table.] People have stopped believing in the horrors of witchcraft, but... I know the truth.

Camila: Woah. Luz, this is quite a detailed story.

Jacob: [Walking towards concealed cage.] But now I've got proof that otherworldly beings exist! Behold!

[Jacob pulls back the rug to reveal Vee in the cage with duct tape over her mouth.]

Camila: [Alongside multiple shots of Vee's features.] Oh, wow! That is a very... convincing... [Realization.] costume? [Loud gasp.]

Jacob: A costume? This is a real life demon! C'mere, watch this.

[Jacob runs over to a series of four monitors, displaying a video where Vee transforms into her true form. The camera focuses on Camila for most of the shot, who is completely shocked by it.]

Jacob: More vile beings will probably come to its rescue. But I can protect humanity. I even had some custom gear made at the renaissance fair. Usually I don't take it out for just anyone, but what the heck! If I'm gonna be working with the government, I might as well show off a little.

[Jacob takes a hook and tries to get the suit of armor down. This serves as a distraction for him.]

Camila: Luz, come on. I don't like this game anymore.

Luz: It's not a game, Mama. Everything I told you was true.

Camila: So that thing has been living with me the entire time? It's just a lot to believe...

Luz: Her name is Vee, and she may look different, but she's not bad. Please, you gotta help her!

[Camila turns to Vee and walks towards her. Vee braces in expectation that she would be hit, but Camila crouches to talk to Vee instead.]

Camila: Hello... this is all so confusing, but... who knew I had such a strong girl living under my roof this whole time?

[Vee is touched by that and starts to tear up, but is interrupted by Jacob wearing the suit of armor.]

Jacob: So how do I look? Maybe we can collaborate on a version that can survive the battles on Mars? [Notices Camila's phone, gasps.] Wait, what is that? Are you recording this?

Camila: Uh...

Jacob: Wonderful! Well I was gonna wait until after the press tour, but let's begin our live dissection of this demon right now!

Camila: Stop! Uh, the... the President just called. Yeah, and, uh...

[Camila looks at her phone where Luz is signalling to her.]

Camila: Uh... Y'know what? I don't have the imagination for this. I will be taking this innocent child with me, and you will never bother us again.

Jacob: What? No absolutely not! We made a verbal agreement—

Camila: Mister. [Brandishing an upside-down slingshot.] You better back the heck down, or I will tell the police you have been illegally setting up traps and cameras on private property! [Drops the slingshot.]

Jacob: I won't let you take away my discovery. I'm the good guy here!

Camila: Yeah. [Takes out a flip-flop from her handbag, aiming it square at Jacob.] A lot of bad guys say that.

[Camila strikes at Jacob with the flip-flop. There is a presumed short timeskip. Cut to outside the building where it is currently raining. Camila and Vee are walking out of the building. Vee has a coat on.]

Vee: Is it okay to leave him in there?

Camila: He'll be fine.

[Cut to the Gravesfield Historical Society building's STAFF room, where Jacob sits in Vee's former cage, unconscious.]

Camila: He can use the time for some self-reflection.

[Another presumed short timeskip, this time Camila and Vee both arrive at the Noceda home, exiting their car. Luz appears through the headlights of the car.]

Luz: Heh! Look what I can do with the rain! Vee! I'm so happy you're okay!

[Luz then attempts to high-five Vee, but Luz's hand phases through.]

Luz: Woah.

Vee: Yeah. Thank you, Camila. For everything.

Camila: Vee. You have a place here for as long as you need. And take these. [Hands Vee a deck of Hexes Hold 'Em cards from her handbag.] Luz said they might be helpful for you.

Vee: Magic!

[Vee starts eating a few of the cards, and walks away.]

Luz: Mom, you were awesome back there! Thanks for being cool... about everything.

Camila: [Starting to cry.] I'm trying to hold it together... I really am... But I have never been this scared before. A demon realm? Magic? How are you gonna get back here? Is this the only way I can touch you?

[Camila attempts to hold Luz's hand, but it just phases through again.]

Luz: I... I need a little more time, but if I keep working my hardest I will make a working portal, I promise!

Camila: As scary as this is, it really does seem like you've matured.

Luz: Yes! I've learned so much... Staying here was the best decision I ever made.

Camila: You... [Getting angry.] chose to stay there?

Luz: Oh, uh...

Camila: Were you trying to live out some witch fantasy? Did you... did you hate living with me that much? [Turns to look at Luz with a hurt expression.]

Luz: Mama, no!

[Luz is then dragged back up by the rope she is attached to. Cut back to the In Between Realm.]

Luz: No. [Pulls herself down on the rope.] Not yet. Not... yet! Mom!

[Luz drops the hovering cube. A wide shot of the In Between Realm reveals Camila's face on many of the cubes. Cut back to the human realm.]

Luz: I'm being pulled back!

Camila: Baby? No, no, no, no, no, no... [Luz is pulled back further.] When you come home, promise you'll stay here. I didn't mean to push you away. I swear things will be different.

Luz: [Starts tearing up.] Mom, it's not you, it never was!

Camila: Promise me, Luz... please!

Luz: [Sad expression.] Okay, Mom. I promise. [Fades away from view.]

[Camila cries. Cut back to Luz in the In Between Realm, who is being pulled back with a rope. The camera rotates as Luz is pulled back to the portal to the other side of the In Between Realm.]

Luz: Mom! [Tears dripping from her eyes.]

[She is pulled back further, splashing into the water. For a brief time, only her glowing outline remains before fading from the In Between Realm. Back at the Boiling Isles outside the Owl House, Eda, King, and Hooty are pulling back on the rope attached to the portal. The portal itself seems to be leaking some kind of black viscous liquid, perhaps the same kind of liquid that was shown in the In Between Realm.]

Eda: And pull, and pull, and...

[Luz arrives back at the Boiling Isles, flying out of the portal. Eda, King, and Hooty are all sent flying back too. They all land on each other.]

King, Eda, Hooty: Luz! [All get up.]

Eda: I'm sorry, I had to pull you out. The portal was closing.

[Cut to the portal, which creaks, then folds in on itself in a ball, finally disappearing in a puff of smoke.]

King: [Hops onto Luz's shoulder.] Did you talk to your mom? Did you mention me?

Luz: Yeah. Mama... Mom can't wait to meet you guys.

Eda: Well, just rest up now, okay? And don't you worry, kiddo. With everything we've learned, we'll have a real working portal in no time.

King: I'm gonna eat human snacks!

Hooty: [From behind the others.] I can't wait to share parenting tips!

Eda: Who dubbed you a parent? [All laugh, except for Luz.]
